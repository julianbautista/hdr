  abstract = {We investigate methods to best estimate the normalization of the mass density fluctuation power spectrum (σ8) using peculiar velocity data from a survey like the six-degree Field Galaxy Velocity Survey (6dFGSv). We focus on two potential problems: (i) biases from non-linear growth of structure and (ii) the large number of velocities in the survey. Simulations of ΛCDM-like models are used to test the methods. We calculate the likelihood from a full covariance matrix of velocities averaged in grid cells. This simultaneously reduces the number of data points and smoothes out non-linearities which tend to dominate on small scales. We show how the averaging can be taken into account in the predictions in a practical way, and show the effect of the choice of cell size. We find that a cell size can be chosen that significantly reduces the non-linearities without significantly increasing the error bars on cosmological parameters. We compare our results with those from a principal components analysis following Watkins et al. and Feldman et al. to select a set of optimal moments constructed from linear combinations of the peculiar velocities that are least sensitive to the non-linear scales. We conclude that averaging in grid cells performs equally well. We find that for a survey such as 6dFGSv we can estimate σ8 with less than 3 per cent bias from non-linearities. The expected error on σ8 after marginalizing over Ωm is approximately 16 per cent.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints from the SFI++ galaxy peculiar velocity survey, the largest galaxy peculiar velocity sample to date. The analysis is performed by using the gridding method developed in Abate et al. We concentrate on constraining parameters which are affected by the clustering of matter: σ8 and the growth index γ. Assuming a concordance Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, we find σ8 = 0.91+0.22-0.18 and γ = 0.55+0.13-0.14 after marginalizing over Ωm. These constraints are consistent with, and have constraining power similar to, the same constraints from other current data sets which use different methods. Recently, there have been several claims that the peculiar velocity measurements do not agree with ΛCDM. Instead, we find that, although a higher value of σ8 and a lower value of Ωm are preferred, the values are still consistent when compared with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5 results. We note that although our analysis probes a variety of scales, the constraints will be dominated by the smaller scales, which have the smallest uncertainties. These results show that peculiar velocity analysis is a vital probe of cosmology, providing competitive constraints on parameters such as σ8. Its sensitivity to the derivative of growth function, particularly down to redshift zero, means that it can provide a vital low redshift anchor on the evolution of structure formation. The importance of utilizing different probes with varying systematics is also an essential requirement for providing a consistency check on the best-fitting cosmological model.},

  abstract = {Peculiar velocities of galaxies hosting Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)  generate a significant systematic effect in deriving the dark energy equation of state w, at level of a few per cent. Here, we illustrate how the peculiar velocity effect in SNeIa data can be turned from a `systematic' into a probe of cosmological parameters. We assume a flat Λcold dark matter model (w = -1) and use low- and high-redshift SNe Ia data to derive simultaneously three distinct estimates of the matter density Ωm which appear in the problem: from the geometry, from the dynamics and from the shape of the matter power spectrum. We find that each of the three Ωm's agrees with the canonical value Ωm = 0.25 to within 1σ, for reasonably assumed fluctuation amplitude and Hubble parameter. This is consistent with the standard cosmological scenario for both the geometry and the growth of structure. For fixed Ωm = 0.25 for all three Ωm's, we constrain γ = 0.72 +/- 0.21 in the growth factor of Ωm(z)γ, so we cannot currently distinguish between standard Einstein gravity and predictions from some modified gravity models. Future surveys of thousands of SNe Ia, or inclusion of peculiar velocity data, could significantly improve the above tests.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg\textsuperscript{2} of imaging data, with most of the \textasciitilde 2000 deg\textsuperscript{2} increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120° long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg\textsuperscript{2}. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg\textsuperscript{2} the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

This result is completely independent of Hubble constant measurements based on the distance ladder, cosmic microwave background anisotropies (both temperature and polarization), and strong lensing constraints. There are now five data sets that: (a) have no shared observational systematics; and (b) each constrains the Hubble constant with fractional uncertainty at the few-per cent level. We compare these five independent estimates, and find that, as a set, the differences between them are significant at the 2.5σ level (χ\textsuperscript{2}/dof = 24/11, probability to exceed = 1.1 per cent). Having set the threshold for consistency at 3σ, we combine all five data sets to arrive at H\_0=69.3\^\{+0.4\}\_\{-0.6\} \{km s\^\{-1\} Mpc\^\{-1\}\}.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg\textsuperscript{2} of griz imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric-redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while "blind" to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat Λ CDM and w CDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for Λ CDM ) or 7 (for w CDM ) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 ×457 element analytic covariance matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point functions and from their combination obtain S\textsubscript{8}≡σ\textsubscript{8}(Ω\textsubscript{m}/0.3 )0.\textsuperscript{5}=0.77 3\textsubscript{-0.020}\textsuperscript{+0.026} and Ω\textsubscript{m}=0.26 7\textsubscript{-0.017}\textsuperscript{+0.030} for Λ CDM ; for w CDM , we find S\textsubscript{8}=0.78 2\textsubscript{-0.024}\textsuperscript{+0.036}, Ω\textsubscript{m}=0.28 4\textsubscript{-0.030}\textsuperscript{+0.033}, and w =-0.8 2\textsubscript{-0.20}\textsuperscript{+0.21} at 68\% C.L. The precision of these DES Y1 constraints rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms. Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for S\textsubscript{8} and Ω\textsubscript{m} are lower than the central values from Planck for both Λ CDM and w CDM , the Bayes factor indicates that the DES Y1 and Planck data sets are consistent with each other in the context of Λ CDM . Combining DES Y1 with Planck, baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements from SDSS, 6dF, and BOSS and type Ia supernovae from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis data set, we derive very tight constraints on cosmological parameters: S\textsubscript{8}=0.802 ±0.012 and Ω\textsubscript{m}=0.298 ±0.007 in Λ CDM and w =-1.0 0\textsubscript{-0.04}\textsuperscript{+0.05} in w CDM . Upcoming Dark Energy Survey analyses will provide more stringent tests of the Λ CDM model and extensions such as a time-varying equation of state of dark energy or modified gravity. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present constraints on extensions of the minimal cosmological models  dominated by dark matter and dark energy, Λ CDM and w CDM , by using a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing from the first-year data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1) in combination with external data. We consider four extensions of the minimal dark energy-dominated scenarios: (1) nonzero curvature Ωk, (2) number of relativistic species Neff different from the standard value of 3.046, (3) time-varying equation-of-state of dark energy described by the parameters w0 and wa (alternatively quoted by the values at the pivot redshift, wp, and wa), and (4) modified gravity described by the parameters μ0 and Σ0 that modify the metric potentials. We also consider external information from Planck cosmic microwave background measurements; baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from SDSS, 6dF, and BOSS; redshift-space distortion measurements from BOSS; and type Ia supernova information from the Pantheon compilation of datasets. Constraints on curvature and the number of relativistic species are dominated by the external data; when these are combined with DES Y1, we find Ωk=0.002 0-0.0032+0.0037 at the 68\% confidence level, and the upper limit Neff{$<$}3.28 (3.55 ) at 68\% (95\%) confidence, assuming a hard prior Neff{$>$}3.0 . For the time-varying equation-of-state, we find the pivot value (wp,wa)=(-0.9 1-0.23+0.19,-0.5 7-1.11+0.93) at pivot redshift zp=0.27 from DES alone, and (wp,wa)=(-1.0 1-0.04+0.04,-0.2 8-0.48+0.37) at zp=0.20 from DES Y1 combined with external data; in either case we find no evidence for the temporal variation of the equation of state. For modified gravity, we find the present-day value of the relevant parameters to be Σ0=0.4 3-0.29+0.28 from DES Y1 alone, and (Σ0,μ0)=(0.0 6-0.07+0.08,-0.1 1-0.46+0.42) from DES Y1 combined with external data. These modified-gravity constraints are consistent with predictions from general relativity.},

  abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since 2014 July. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the 14th from SDSS overall (making this Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes the data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (2014-2016 July) public. Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey; the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data-driven machine-learning algorithm known as “The Cannon” and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from the SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS web site ({$<$}A href="http://www.sdss.org"{$>$}www.sdss.org{$<$}/A{$>$}) has been updated for this release and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020 and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

  abstract = {We show that a large-area imaging survey using narrow-band filters could detect quasars in sufficiently high number densities, and with more than sufficient accuracy in their photometric redshifts, to turn them into suitable tracers of large-scale structure. If a narrow-band optical survey can detect objects as faint as i=23, it could reach volumetric number densities as high as 10\^\{-4\} h\^3 Mpc\^\{-3\} (comoving) at z\textasciitilde 1.5 . Such a catalog would lead to precision measurements of the power spectrum up to z\textasciitilde 3-4. We also show that it is possible to employ quasars to measure baryon acoustic oscillations at high redshifts, where the uncertainties from redshift distortions and nonlinearities are much smaller than at z{$<$}1. As a concrete example we study the future impact of J-PAS, which is a narrow-band imaging survey in the optical over 1/5 of the unobscured sky with 42 filters of \textasciitilde 100 A full-width at half-maximum. We show that J-PAS will be able to take advantage of the broad emission lines of quasars to deliver excellent photometric redshifts, \textbackslash sigma\_\{z\}\textasciitilde 0.002(1+z), for millions of objects.},

While the BAO data alone cannot constrain H 0, we show that combining the latest BAO results with WMAP, Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), or South Pole Telescope (SPT) CMB data produces values of H 0 that are 2.4\{--\}3.1σ lower than the distance ladder, independent of Planck, and that this downward pull was less apparent in some earlier analyses that used only angle-averaged BAO scale constraints rather than full anisotropic information. At the same time, the combination of BAO and CMB data also disfavors the lower values of H 0 preferred by the Planck high-multipole temperature power spectrum. Combining galaxy and Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO with a precise estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance produces \{H\}0=66.98+/- 1.18 km s‑1 Mpc‑1 for the flat \{\{Λ \}\}\{CDM\} model. This value is completely independent of CMB anisotropy constraints and is 3.0σ lower than the latest distance ladder constraint, although 2.4σ tension also exists between the galaxy BAO and Ly$\alpha$ BAO. These results show that it is not possible to explain the H 0 disagreement solely with a systematic error specific to the Planck data. The fact that tensions remain even after the removal of any single data set makes this intriguing puzzle all the more challenging to resolve.},

We show that tension exists between cosmological constant cold dark matter (LCDM) model parameters inferred from multipoles l{$<$}1000 (roughly those accessible to WMAP), and from l{$>$}=1000, particularly the CDM density, Omega\_ch\^2, which is discrepant at 2.5 sigma for a Planck-motivated prior on the optical depth, tau=0.07+/-0.02. We find some parameter tensions to be larger than previously reported because of inaccuracy in the code used by the Planck Collaboration to generate model spectra. The Planck l{$>$}=1000 constraints are also in tension with low-redshift data sets, including Planck's own measurement of the CMB lensing power spectrum (2.4 sigma), and the most precise baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination (2.5 sigma). The Hubble constant predicted by Planck from l{$>$}=1000, H\_0=64.1+/-1.7 km/s/Mpc, disagrees with the most precise local distance ladder measurement of 73.0+/-2.4 km/s/Mpc at the 3.0 sigma level, while the Planck value from l{$<$}1000, 69.7+/-1.7 km/s/Mpc, is consistent within 1 sigma. A discrepancy between the Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT) high-multipole CMB spectra disfavors interpreting these tensions as evidence for new physics. We conclude that the parameters from the Planck high-multipole spectrum probably differ from the underlying values due to either an unlikely statistical fluctuation or unaccounted-for systematics persisting in the Planck data.},

From the cross spectra, we obtain evidence for gravitational lensing of the CMB polarization at a statistical significance of 4.0σ and indication of the presence of a lensing B-mode signal at a significance of 2.3σ. We demonstrate that our results are not biased by instrumental and astrophysical systematic errors by performing null tests, checks with simulated and real data, and analytical calculations. This measurement of polarization lensing, made via the robust cross-correlation channel, not only reinforces POLARBEAR auto-correlation measurements, but also represents one of the early steps towards establishing CMB polarization lensing as a powerful new probe of cosmology and astrophysics. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We obtained high-resolution spectra of eight bright quasars (QSOs) at 3.1-1 comoving Mpc of LBGs and more than average at slightly larger distances 1 h-1 comoving Mpc{$<\sptilde$}r{$<\sptilde$}5 h-1 comoving Mpc. The intergalactic medium within the largest overdensities at z\textasciitilde 3, which will presumably evolve into the intracluster medium by z\textasciitilde 0, is rich in neutral hydrogen and C IV. The lack of H I absorption at small distances from LBGs appears unlikely to be produced solely by the Lyman continuum radiation they emit; it may show that the galaxies' supernova-driven winds maintain their measured outflow velocities of \textasciitilde 600 km s-1 for a few hundred million years and drive away nearby intergalactic gas. We present correlation functions of galaxies with Ly$\alpha$ forest flux decrements, with C IV systems, and with other galaxies. We describe the association of galaxies with damped Ly$\alpha$ systems and with intergalactic He II opacity. A strong observed correlation of galaxies with intergalactic metals supports the idea that LBG winds have enriched their surroundings. Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M.

  abstract = {Gravitational lensing due to the large-scale distribution of matter in the cosmos distorts the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) and thereby induces new, small-scale B-mode polarization. This signal carries detailed information about the distribution of all the gravitating matter between the observer and CMB last scattering surface. We report the first direct evidence for polarization lensing based on purely CMB information, from using the four-point correlations of even- and odd-parity E- and B-mode polarization mapped over ̃30 square degrees of the sky measured by the POLARBEAR experiment. These data were analyzed using a blind analysis framework and checked for spurious systematic contamination using null tests and simulations. Evidence for the signal of polarization lensing and lensing B modes is found at 4.2σ (stat +sys) significance. The amplitude of matter fluctuations is measured with a precision of 27\%, and is found to be consistent with the Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model. This measurement demonstrates a new technique, capable of mapping all gravitating matter in the Universe, sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses, and essential for cleaning the lensing B-mode signal in searches for primordial gravitational waves. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present a public code to generate a mock galaxy catalog in redshift space assuming a log-normal probability density function (PDF) of galaxy and matter density fields. We draw galaxies by Poisson-sampling the log-normal field, and calculate the velocity field from the linearised continuity equation of matter fields, assuming zero vorticity. This procedure yields a PDF of the pairwise velocity fields that is qualitatively similar to that of N-body simulations. We check fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation function and power spectrum in real space agree with the input precisely. We find that a linear bias relation in the power spectrum does not guarantee a linear bias relation in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation coefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We also find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping provides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is, non-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the Jacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales that is qualitatively similar to that of the well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not include random velocities. This damping is a consequence of non-linearity in the Jacobian, and thus attributing the damping of the power spectrum solely to FoG, as commonly done in the literature, is misleading.},

Using the neutral current (NC), elastic scattering, and charged current reactions and assuming the standard 8B shape, the νe component of the 8B solar flux is φe=1.76+0.05−0.05(stat)+0.09−0.09(syst)×106cm−2s−1 for a kinetic energy threshold of 5 MeV. The non- νe component is φμτ=3.41+0.45−0.45(stat)+0.48−0.45(syst)×106cm−2s−1, 5.3σ greater than zero, providing strong evidence for solar νe flavor transformation. The total flux measured with the NC reaction is φNC=5.09+0.44−0.43(stat)+0.46−0.43(syst)×106cm−2s−1, consistent with solar models.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) presents the first  spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This ninth data release (DR9) of the SDSS project includes 535,995 new galaxy spectra (median z \textasciitilde{} 0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra (median z \textasciitilde{} 2.32), and 90,897 new stellar spectra, along with the data presented in previous data releases. These spectra were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in temperature estimates for stars with T eff {$<$} 5000 K and in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H] {$>$} -0.5. DR9 includes new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SEGUE-2. The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the APOGEE along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final SDSS-III data release in 2014 December.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has been in operation since 2000 April. This paper presents the Tenth Public Data Release (DR10) from its current incarnation, SDSS-III. This data release includes the first spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), along with spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) taken through 2012 July. The APOGEE instrument is a near-infrared R \textasciitilde{} 22,500 300 fiber spectrograph covering 1.514-1.696 μm. The APOGEE survey is studying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 red giant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the Milky Way. DR10 includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or more times, from APOGEE. Derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities, effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are also included. DR10 also roughly doubles the number of BOSS spectra over those included in the Ninth Data Release. DR10 includes a total of 1,507,954 BOSS spectra comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra, 182,009 quasar spectra, and 159,327 stellar spectra selected over 6373.2 deg\textsuperscript{2}.},

This is the first release of data from the Southern Hemisphere survey of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2); new data from APOGEE-2 North are also included. DR16 is also notable as the final data release for the main cosmological program of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), and all raw and reduced spectra from that project are released here. DR16 also includes all the data from the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey and new data from the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Survey programs, both of which were co-observed on eBOSS plates. DR16 has no new data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey (or the MaNGA Stellar Library "MaStar"). We also preview future SDSS-V operations (due to start in 2020), and summarize plans for the final SDSS-IV data release (DR17).},

  abstract = {We present new arcminute-resolution maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, using data taken from 2013-2016 at 98 and 150 GHz. The maps cover more than 17,000 deg\$\^2\$, the deepest 600 deg\$\^2\$ with noise levels below 10 \$\textbackslash mu\$K-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg\$\^2\$ of these maps to constrain cosmology. The ACT data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, \$H\_0\$. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure \$H\_0 = 67.6 \textbackslash pm 1.1\$ km/s/Mpc, at 68\% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find \$H\_0 = 67.9 \textbackslash pm 1.5\$ km/s/Mpc). The \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model provides a good fit to the ACT data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$; the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM predictions to within \$1.5 - 2.2\textbackslash sigma\$. We compare ACT, WMAP, and Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the constraints on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters readjust when adding CMB large-scale information that ACT does not measure. The DR4 products presented here will be publicly released on the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis.},

  abstract = {We report on the neutrino mass measurement result from the first  four-week science run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment KATRIN in spring 2019. Beta-decay electrons from a high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are energy analyzed by a high-resolution MAC-E filter. A fit of the integrated electron spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic end point at 18.57 keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of (-1.0-1.1+0.9) eV2. From this, we derive an upper limit of 1.1 eV (90\% confidence level) on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRIN sensitivity. It improves upon previous mass limits from kinematic measurements by almost a factor of 2 and provides model-independent input to cosmological studies of structure formation.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data  set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc3, divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51 and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method, in combination with a cosmic microwave background prior on the sound horizon scale, after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product DMH from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by fσ8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAOs by breaking degeneracy between DM and H. Combined with Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature ΩK = 0.0003 ± 0.0026 and a dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.01 ± 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter (CDM) model with a cosmological constant (ΛCDM). Our RSD measurements of fσ8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8 ± 1.2 km s-1 Mpc-1. Assuming flat ΛCDM, we find Ωm = 0.310 ± 0.005 and H0 = 67.6 ± 0.5 km s-1 Mpc-1, and we find a 95 per cent upper limit of 0.16 eV c-2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

  abstract = {We present the cosmological implications from final measurements of clustering using galaxies, quasars, and Ly$\alpha$ forests from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) lineage of experiments in large-scale structure. These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, rd, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, fσ8, from redshift-space distortions (RSD). This composite sample is the most constraining of its kind and allows us to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cosmological model after two decades of dedicated spectroscopic observation. We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, ΛCDM model that allows for curvature. When combined with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of temperature and polarization, under the same model, the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement on curvature constraints relative to primary CMB constraints alone. Independent of distance measurements, the SDSS RSD data complement weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in demonstrating a preference for a flat ΛCDM cosmological model when combined with Planck measurements. The combined BAO and RSD measurements indicate σ8=0.85±0.03, implying a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck temperature and polarization data and with General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD, Planck, Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and DES weak lensing and clustering measurements, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a ΛCDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on each of the three parameters, ΩΛ, H0, and σ8, remains at roughly 1\%, showing changes of less than 0.6\% in the central values between models. In a model that allows for free curvature and a time-evolving equation of state for dark energy, the combined samples produce a constraint Ωk=−0.0022±0.0022. The dark energy constraints lead to w0=−0.909±0.081 and wa=−0.49+0.35−0.30, corresponding to an equation of state of wp=−1.018±0.032 at a pivot redshift zp=0.29 and a Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit of 94. The inverse distance ladder measurement under this model yields H0=68.18±0.79 km s−1 Mpc−1, remaining in tension with several direct determination methods; the BAO data allow Hubble constant estimates that are robust against the assumption of the cosmological model. In addition, the BAO data allow estimates of H0 that are independent of the CMB data, with similar central values and precision under a ΛCDM model. Our most constraining combination of data gives the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses at ∑mν{$<$}0.115 eV (95\% confidence). Finally, we consider the improvements in cosmology constraints over the last decade by comparing our results to a sample representative of the period 2000–2010. We compute the relative gain across the five dimensions spanned by w, Ωk, ∑mν, H0, and σ8 and find that the SDSS BAO and RSD data reduce the total posterior volume by a factor of 40 relative to the previous generation. Adding again the Planck, DES, and Pantheon SN Ia samples leads to an overall contraction in the five-dimensional posterior volume of 3 orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All of the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 deg\textsuperscript{2} of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include the measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 5200 deg\textsuperscript{2} of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 deg\textsuperscript{2}; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 of the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

  abstract = {We develop a new Multitracer Halo Occupation Distribution (MTHOD)  framework for the galaxy distribution and apply it to the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) final data between z = 0.7 - 1.1. We obtain a best fitting MTHOD for each tracer and describe the host halo properties of these galaxies. The mean halo masses for LRGs, ELGs, and QSOs are found to be \$1.9 \textbackslash times 10\^\{13\} \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$ , \$1.1 \textbackslash times 10\^\{12\} \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$ , and \$5 \textbackslash times 10\^\{12\} \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$ respectively in the eBOSS data. We use the MTHOD framework to create mock galaxy catalogues and predict auto- and cross-correlation functions for all the tracers. Comparing these results with data, we investigate galactic conformity, the phenomenon whereby the properties of neighbouring galaxies are mutually correlated in a manner that is not captured by the basic halo model. We detect 1-halo conformity at more than 3σ statistical significance, while obtaining upper limits on 2-halo conformity. We also look at the environmental dependence of the galaxy quenching efficiency and find that halo mass driven quenching successfully explains the behaviour in high density regions, but it fails to describe the quenching efficiency in low density regions. In particular, we show that the quenching efficiency in low density filaments is higher in the observed data, as compared to the prediction of the MTHOD with halo mass driven quenching. The mock galaxy catalogue constructed in this paper is publicly available on this website1.},

  abstract = {General relativistic effects have long been predicted to subtly influence the observed large-scale structure of the universe. The current generation of galaxy redshift surveys have reached a size where detection of such effects is becoming feasible. In this paper, we report the first detection of the redshift asymmetry from the cross-correlation function of two galaxy populations which is consistent with relativistic effects. The dataset is taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR12 CMASS galaxy sample, and we detect the asymmetry at the \$2.7\textbackslash sigma\$ level by applying a shell-averaged estimator to the cross-correlation function. Our measurement dominates at scales around \$10\$ h\$\^\{-1\}\$Mpc, larger than those over which the gravitational redshift profile has been recently measured in galaxy clusters, but smaller than scales for which linear perturbation theory is likely to be accurate. The detection significance varies by 0.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$ with the details of our measurement and tests for systematic effects. We have also devised two null tests to check for various survey systematics and show that both results are consistent with the null hypothesis. We measure the dipole moment of the cross-correlation function, and from this the asymmetry is also detected, at the \$2.8 \textbackslash sigma\$ level. The amplitude and scale-dependence of the clustering asymmetries are approximately consistent with the expectations of General Relativity and a biased galaxy population, within large uncertainties. We explore theoretical predictions using numerical simulations in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {Shortly after its discovery, General Relativity (GR) was applied to predict the behavior of our Universe on the largest scales, and later became the foundation of modern cosmology. Its validity has been verified on a range of scales and environments from the Solar system to merging black holes. However, experimental confirmations of GR on cosmological scales have so far lacked the accuracy one would hope for -- its applications on those scales being largely based on extrapolation and its validity sometimes questioned in the shadow of the unexpected cosmic acceleration. Future astronomical instruments surveying the distribution and evolution of galaxies over substantial portions of the observable Universe, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), will be able to measure the fingerprints of gravity and their statistical power will allow strong constraints on alternatives to GR. In this paper, based on a set of \$N\$-body simulations and mock galaxy catalogs, we study the predictions of a number of traditional and novel estimators beyond linear redshift distortions in two well-studied modified gravity models, chameleon \$f(R)\$ gravity and a braneworld model, and the potential of testing these deviations from GR using DESI. These estimators employ a wide array of statistical properties of the galaxy and the underlying dark matter field, including two-point and higher-order statistics, environmental dependence, redshift space distortions and weak lensing. We find that they hold promising power for testing GR to unprecedented precision. The major future challenge is to make realistic, simulation-based mock galaxy catalogs for both GR and alternative models to fully exploit the statistic power of the DESI survey and to better understand the impact of key systematic effects. Using these, we identify future simulation and analysis needs for gravity tests using DESI.},

  abstract = {We use the Fisher matrix formalism to study the expansion and growth history of the Universe using galaxy clustering with 2D angular cross-correlation tomography in spectroscopic or high-resolution photometric redshift surveys. The radial information is contained in the cross-correlations between narrow redshift bins. We show how multiple tracers with redshift space distortions cancel sample variance and arbitrarily improve the constraints on the dark energy equation of state ω(z) and the growth parameter γ in the noiseless limit. The improvement for multiple tracers quickly increases with the bias difference between the tracers, up to a factor ∼4 in FoMγω. We model a magnitude limited survey with realistic density and bias using a conditional luminosity function, finding a factor 1.3-9.0 improvement in FoMγω - depending on global density - with a split in a halo mass proxy. Partly overlapping redshift bins improve the constraints in multiple tracer surveys a factor ∼1.3 in FoMγω. This finding also applies to photometric surveys, where the effect of using multiple tracers is magnified. We also show large improvement on the FoM with increasing density, which could be used as a trade-off to compensate some possible loss with radial resolution.},

  abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began observations in 2014 July. It pursues three core programs: the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA), and the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). As well as its core program, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) and the SPectroscopic IDentification of ERosita Sources (SPIDERS). This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13 (DR13). DR13 makes publicly available the first 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing the Sloan Extended QUasar, Emission-line galaxy, Luminous red galaxy Survey (SEQUELS), which also targeted variability-selected objects and X-ray-selected objects. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification, and new reductions of the SDSS-III APOGEE-1 data, improving stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. DR13 provides more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Value-added target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS and an updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE are also available. This paper describes the location and format of the data and provides references to important technical papers. The SDSS web site, {$<$}A href="http://www.sdss.org"{$>$}http://www.sdss.org{$<$}/A{$>$}, provides links to the data, tutorials, examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures.

The test involves the evaluation of the ratio between the differences in the redshifts of an expanding spherically symmetric distribution of radiation-emitting objects and the product of their distance with the angular radius of their distribution on the sky assuming a homogeneous, isotropic cosmology described by the Robertson-Walker metric. In the case where the cosmological constant is not equal to zero, this ratio is shown to vary significantly with a change in object distance and other parameters. Difficulties associated with the peculiar velocities and clustering of galaxies, the presumable test objects, are discussed.}

  abstract = {Future surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will observe an order of magnitude more astrophysical transient events than any previous survey before. With this deluge of photometric data, it will be impossible for all such events to be classified by humans alone. Recent efforts have sought to leverage machine learning methods to tackle the challenge of astronomical transient classification, with ever improving success. Transformers are a recently developed deep learning architecture, first proposed for natural language processing, that have shown a great deal of recent success. In this work we develop a new transformer architecture, which uses multi-head self attention at its core, for general multi-variate time-series data. Furthermore, the proposed time-series transformer architecture supports the inclusion of an arbitrary number of additional features, while also offering interpretability. We apply the time-series transformer to the task of photometric classification, minimising the reliance of expert domain knowledge for feature selection, while achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art photometric classification methods. We achieve a weighted logarithmic-loss of 0.507 on imbalanced data in a representative setting using data from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC). Moreover, we achieve a micro-averaged receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.98 and micro-averaged precision-recall area under curve of 0.87.},

Nyx follows the temporal evolution of a system of discrete dark matter particles gravitationally coupled to an inviscid ideal fluid in an expanding universe. The gas is advanced in an Eulerian framework with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement; a particle-mesh scheme using the same grid hierarchy is used to solve for self-gravity and advance the particles. Computational results demonstrating the validation of Nyx on standard cosmological test problems, and the scaling behavior of Nyx to 50,000 cores, are presented.},

We make consistent measurements of the lensing signal of both samples in both Fourier and configuration space. By interpreting the excess signal present in the DLA catalog with respect to the parent quasar catalog as caused by the large scale structure traced by DLAs, we are able to infer the bias of these objects: b\textsubscript{DLA}=2.6±0.9. These results are consistent with previous measurements made in cross-correlation with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, although the current noise in the lensing data and the low number density of DLAs limits the constraining power of this measurement. We discuss the robustness of the analysis with respect to a number different systematic effects and forecast prospects of carrying out this measurement with data from future experiments. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {The statistics of primordial curvature fluctuations are our window into the period of inflation, where these fluctuations were generated. To date, the cosmic microwave background has been the dominant source of information about these perturbations. Large scale structure is however from where drastic improvements should originate. In this paper, we explain the theoretical motivations for pursuing such measurements and the challenges that lie ahead. In particular, we discuss and identify theoretical targets regarding the measurement of primordial non-Gaussianity. We argue that when quantified in terms of the local (equilateral) template amplitude \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm NL\}\^\{\textbackslash rm loc\}\$ (\$f\_\{\textbackslash rm NL\}\^\{\textbackslash rm eq\}\$), natural target levels of sensitivity are \$\textbackslash Delta f\_\{\textbackslash rm NL\}\^\{\textbackslash rm loc, eq.\} \textbackslash simeq 1\$. We highlight that such levels are within reach of future surveys by measuring 2-, 3- and 4-point statistics of the galaxy spatial distribution.

The main goal of Euclid is to understand the origin of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Euclid will explore the expansion history of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and red-shifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis. This review has been planned and carried out within Euclid's Theory Working Group and is meant to provide a guide to the scientific themes that will underlie the activity of the group during the preparation of the Euclid mission.},

Here we show that by measuring the power spectrum of density contrast and of peculiar velocities of supernovae one can estimate also \$H(z)/H\_\{0\}\$ regardless of background or linearly perturbed cosmology and of galaxy-matter bias. This method, dubbed Clustering of Standard Candles (CSC) also yields the redshift distortion parameter \$\textbackslash beta(k,z)\$ and the galaxy power spectrum.

(2) Are these observables sufficient to rule out not just a particular dark energy model, but the entire general class of viable models comprising a single scalar field? This paper bears both good and bad news. On one hand, we find that the goal of reconstructing dark energy models is fundamentally limited by the unobservability of the present values of the matter density Ω\textsubscript{m0}, the perturbation normalization σ\textsubscript{8} as well as the present matter power spectrum. On the other, we find that, under certain conditions, cosmological observations can nonetheless rule out the entire class of the most general single scalar-field models, i.e., those based on the Horndeski Lagrangian. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

Assuming a concordance ΛCDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n¯≈3×10-4 h-3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5σ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7σ. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 ± 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 ± 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7σ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 km s-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant.},

The amplitude of the cross-power spectrum is low relative to the expected dark matter power spectrum, assuming a neutral hydrogen (H I) bias and mass density equal to measurements from the ALFALFA survey. The decrement is pronounced and statistically significant at small scales. At k ˜ 1.5 h Mpc-1, the cross-power spectrum is more than a factor of 6 lower than expected, with a significance of 15.3 σ. This decrement indicates a lack of clustering of neutral hydrogen (H I), a small correlation coefficient between optical galaxies and H I, or some combination of the two. Separating 2dF into red and blue galaxies, we find that red galaxies are much more weakly correlated with H I on k ˜ 1.5 h Mpc-1 scales, suggesting that H I is more associated with blue star-forming galaxies and tends to avoid red galaxies.},

  abstract = {We derive the molecular properties for a sample of 301 Galactic H II regions including 123 ultra compact (UC), 105 compact, and 73 diffuse nebulae. We analyze all sources within the BU-FCRAO Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) of 13CO emission known to be H II regions based upon the presence of radio continuum and cm-wavelength radio recombination line emission. Unlike all previous large area coverage 13CO surveys, the GRS is fully sampled in angle and yet covers \textasciitilde 75 deg2 of the Inner Galaxy. The angular resolution of the GRS (46'') allows us to associate molecular gas with H II regions without ambiguity and to investigate the physical properties of this molecular gas. We find clear CO/H II morphological associations in position and velocity for \textasciitilde 80\% of the nebular sample. Compact H II region molecular gas clouds are on average larger than UC clouds: 2farcm2 compared to 1farcm7. Compact and UC H II regions have very similar molecular properties, with \textasciitilde 5 K line intensities and \textasciitilde 4 km s-1 line widths. The diffuse H II region molecular gas has lower line intensities, \textasciitilde 3 K, and smaller line widths, \textasciitilde 3.5 km s-1. These latter characteristics are similar to those found for quiescent molecular clouds in the GRS. Our sample nebulae thus show evidence for an evolutionary sequence wherein small, dense molecular gas clumps associated with UC H II regions grow into older compact nebulae and finally fragment and dissipate into large, diffuse nebulae.},

  abstract = {We present and test a method that dramatically reduces variance arising from the sparse sampling of wavemodes in cosmological simulations. The method uses two simulations which are fixed (the initial Fourier mode amplitudes are fixed to the ensemble average power spectrum) and paired (with initial modes exactly out of phase). We measure the power spectrum, monopole and quadrupole redshift-space correlation functions, halo mass function and reduced bispectrum at \$z=1\$. By these measures, predictions from a fixed pair can be as precise on non-linear scales as an average over 50 traditional simulations. The fixing procedure introduces a non-Gaussian correction to the initial conditions; we give an analytic argument showing why the simulations are still able to predict the mean properties of the Gaussian ensemble. We anticipate that the method will drive down the computational time requirements for accurate large-scale explorations of galaxy bias and clustering statistics, enabling more precise comparisons with theoretical models, and facilitating the use of numerical simulations in cosmological data interpretation.},

Our approach explicitly incorporates the effects of tidal fields and stochasticity on halo formation, as well as the presence of velocity bias, spatially correlated merger histories, and the connection of all these with the observable and physical properties of galaxies. We measure significant deviations in the shape of the BAO peak from the expectations of a linear bias model built on top of the non-linear dark matter distribution. We find that the galaxy correlation function shows an excess close to the maximum of the BAO peak (r ̃ 110 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc) and a deficit at r ̃ 90 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. Depending on the redshift, selection criteria and number density of the galaxy samples, these biased distortions can be up to 5 per cent in amplitude. They are, however, largely absorbed by marginalization over nuisance parameters in current analytical modelling of the BAO peak in configuration space, in particular into the parameter that controls the broadening due to non-linear evolution. As a result, the galaxy formation effects detected here are unlikely to bias the high-precision measurements planned by the upcoming generation of wide-field galaxy surveys.},

We then recap the relevant numerical approaches: discretization of the phase-space distribution (focusing on N-body but including alternatives, e.g., Lagrangian submanifold and Schrödinger-Poisson) and the respective techniques for their time evolution and force calculation (direct summation, mesh techniques, and hierarchical tree methods). We pay attention to the creation of initial conditions and the connection with Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. We then discuss the possible alternatives in terms of the micro-physical properties of dark matter (e.g., neutralinos, warm dark matter, QCD axions, Bose-Einstein condensates, and primordial black holes), and extensions to account for multiple fluids (baryons and neutrinos), primordial non-Gaussianity and modified gravity. We continue by discussing challenges involved in achieving highly accurate predictions. A key aspect of cosmological simulations is the connection to cosmological observables, we discuss various techniques in this regard: structure finding, galaxy formation and baryonic modelling, the creation of emulators and light-cones, and the role of machine learning. We finalise with a recount of state-of-the-art large-scale simulations and conclude with an outlook for the next decade.},

  abstract = {Context. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey will image  billions of galaxies every few nights for ten years, and as such, should be a major contributor to precision cosmology in the 2020s. High precision photometric data will be available in six bands, from near-infrared to near-ultraviolet. The computation of precise, unbiased, photometric redshifts up to at least z = 2 is one of the main LSST challenges and its performance will have major impact on all extragalactic LSST sciences. Aims: We evaluate the efficiency of our photometric redshift reconstruction on mock galaxy catalogues up to z = 2.45 and estimate the impact of realistic photometric redshift (photo-z) reconstruction on the large-scale structures (LSS) power spectrum and the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination for a LSST-like photometric survey. We study the effectiveness of the BAO scale as a cosmological probe in the LSST survey. Methods: We have performed a detailed modelling of the photo-z distribution as a function of galaxy type, redshift and absolute magnitude using our photo-z reconstruction code with a quality selection cut based on a boosted decision tree (BDT). We have simulated a catalogue of galaxies in the redshift range [0.2-2.45] using the Planck 2015 ΛCDM cosmological parameters over 10 000 square-degrees, in the six bands, assuming LSST photometric precision for a ten-year survey. The mock galaxy catalogues were produced with several redshift error models. The LSS power spectrum was then computed in several redshift ranges and for each error model. Finally we extracted the BAO scale and its uncertainty using only the linear part of the LSS spectrum. Results: We have computed the fractional error on the recovered power spectrum which is dominated by the shot noise at high redshift (z ≳ 1), for scales k ≳ 0.1, due to the photo-z damping. The BAO scale can be recovered with a percent or better accuracy level from z = 0.5 to z = 1.5 using realistic photo-z reconstruction. Conclusions: Reaching the LSST requirements for photo-z reconstruction is crucial to exploit the LSST potential in cosmology, in particular to measure the LSS power spectrum and its evolution with redshift. Although the BAO scale is not the most powerful cosmological probe in LSST, it can be used to check the consistency of the LSS measurement. Moreover we show that the impact of photo-z smearing on the recovered isotropic BAO scale in LSST should stay limited up to z ≈ 1.5, so as long as the galaxy number density balances the photo-z smoothing.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that spots imaged using astronomical CCDs do not exactly scale with flux: bright spots tend to be broader than faint ones, using the same illumination pattern. We measure that the linear size of spots or stars, of typical size 3 to 4 pixels FWHM, increase linearly with their flux by up to 2 \% over the full CCD dynamic range. This brighter-fatter effect affects both deep-depleted and thinned CCD sensors. We propose that this effect is a direct consequence of the distortions of the drift electric field sourced by charges accumulated within the CCD during the exposure and experienced by forthcoming light-induced charges in the same exposure. The pixel boundaries then become slightly dynamical: overfilled pixels become increasingly smaller than their neighbors, so that bright star sizes, measured in number of pixels, appear larger than those of faint stars. This interpretation of the brighter-fatter effect implies that pixels in flat-fields should exhibit statistical correlations, sourced by Poisson fluctuations, that we indeed directly detect. We propose to use the measured correlations in flat-fields to derive how pixel boundaries shift under the influence of a given charge pattern, which allows us in turn to predict how star shapes evolve with flux. We show that, within the precision of our tests, we are able to quantitatively relate the correlations of flat-field pixels and the broadening of stars with flux. This physical model of the brighter-fatter effect also explains the commonly observed phenomenon that the spatial variance of CCD flat-fields increases less rapidly than their average.},

We find that although the commonly used assumption of a degenerate neutrino hierarchy is manifestly wrong and leads to changes in cosmological observables such as the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure compared to the correct (normal or inverted) neutrino hierarchy, the induced changes are so small that even with extremely optimistic assumptions about future data they will remain undetectable. We are thus able to conclude that while cosmology can probe the neutrino contribution to the cosmic energy density extremely precisely (and hence provide a detection of a non-zero total neutrino mass at high significance), it will not be possible to directly measure the individual neutrino masses.},

  abstract = {The Lyman alpha forest power spectrum has been measured on large scales by the BOSS survey in SDSS-III at \$z\textbackslash sim 2.3\$, has been shown to agree well with linear theory predictions, and has provided the first measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at this redshift. However, the power at small scales, affected by non-linearities, has not been well examined so far. We present results from a variety of hydrodynamic simulations to predict the redshift space non-linear power spectrum of the Lyman Alpha transmission for several models, testing the dependence on resolution and box size. A new fitting formula is introduced to facilitate the comparison of our simulation results with observations and other simulations. The non-linear power spectrum has a generic shape determined by a transition scale from linear to non-linear anisotropy, and a Jeans scale below which the power drops rapidly. In addition, we predict the two linear bias factors of the Lyman Alpha forest and provide a better physical interpretation of their values and redshift evolution. The dependence of these bias factors and the non-linear power on the amplitude and slope of the primordial fluctuations power spectrum, the temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium, and the mean Lyman Alpha transmission, as well as the redshift evolution, is investigated and discussed in detail. A preliminary comparison to the observations shows that the predicted redshift distortion parameter is in good agreement with the recent determination of Blomqvist et al., but the density bias factor is lower than observed. We make all our results publicly available in the form of tables of the non-linear power spectrum that is directly obtained from all our simulations, and parameters of our fitting formula.},

In this paper, we provide a simple and fast method to compute the angular power spectrum and bispectrum of any observable. The method is based on using an FFTlog algorithm to decompose the momentum-space statistics onto a basis of power-law functions. For each power law, the integrals over Bessel functions have a simple analytical solution. This allows us to efficiently evaluate these integrals, independently of the value of the multipole l. In particular, this method significantly speeds up the evaluation of the angular bispectrum compared to existing methods. To illustrate our algorithm, we compute the galaxy, lensing and CMB temperature angular power spectrum and bispectrum.},

Building on work of McDonald, we show that Eulerian biasing is only consistent with renormalization if non-local terms and higher-derivative contributions are included in the biasing model. We explicitly determine the complete list of required bias parameters for Gaussian initial conditions, up to quartic order in the dark matter density contrast and at leading order in derivatives. At quadratic order, this means including the gravitational tidal tensor, while at cubic order the velocity potential appears as an independent degree of freedom. Our study naturally leads to an effective theory of biasing in which the halo density is written as a double expansion in fluctuations and spatial derivatives. We show that the bias expansion can be organized in terms of Galileon operators which aren't renormalized at leading order in derivatives. Finally, we discuss how the renormalized bias parameters impact the statistics of halos.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale in redshift-space using the clustering of quasars. We consider a sample of 147,000 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) distributed over 2044 square degrees with redshifts \$0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2\$ and measure their spherically-averaged clustering in both configuration and Fourier space. Our observational dataset and the 1400 simulated realizations of the dataset allow us to detect a preference for BAO that is greater than 2.8\$\textbackslash sigma\$. We determine the spherically averaged BAO distance to \$z = 1.52\$ to 3.8 per cent precision: \$D\_V(z=1.52)=3843\textbackslash pm147 \textbackslash left(r\_\{\textbackslash rm d\}/r\_\{\textbackslash rm d, fid\}\textbackslash right)\textbackslash{} \$Mpc. This is the first time the location of the BAO feature has been measured between redshifts 1 and 2. Our result is fully consistent with the prediction obtained by extrapolating the Planck flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM best-fit cosmology. All of our results are consistent with basic large-scale structure (LSS) theory, confirming quasars to be a reliable tracer of LSS, and provide a starting point for numerous cosmological tests to be performed with eBOSS quasar samples. We combine our result with previous, independent, BAO distance measurements to construct an updated BAO distance-ladder. Using these BAO data alone and marginalizing over the length of the standard ruler, we find \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash Lambda\} {$>$} 0\$ at 6.6\$\textbackslash sigma\$ significance when testing a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model with free curvature.},

However these determinations are limited by several systematic uncertainties which ultimately limit our ability to accurately ascertain the primordial abundance. In this study, we improve the methodologies for solving for the reddening, the emission contributions from collisional excitation of the H I atoms, the effects underlying absorption in the H I and He I emission lines, and the treatment of the blended H I and He I emission at \$\textbackslash lambda\$3889 with the aim of lowering the systematic uncertainties in helium abundance determinations. To apply these methods, we have obtained observations of the He I \$\textbackslash lambda\$10830 emission line in the brightest H II region in the extremely metal-poor (3\$\textbackslash\%\$ Z\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) galaxy Leo P with the LUCI1 instrument on the LBT. We combine this measurement with previous MODS/LBT observations to derive an improved helium abundance. In doing so, our present analysis results in a decrease in the uncertainty in the helium abundance of Leo P by approximately 70\%.

  abstract = {We study the modelling of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) for the eBOSS DR16 emission line galaxies (ELGs). Motivated by previous theoretical and observational studies, we consider different physical effects that can change how ELGs populate haloes. We explore the shape of the average HOD, the fraction of satellite galaxies, their probability distribution function (PDF), and their density and velocity profiles. Our baseline HOD shape was fitted to a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution, with a decaying occupation of central ELGs at high halo masses. We consider Poisson and sub/super-Poissonian PDFs for satellite assignment. We model both Navarro–Frenk–White and particle profiles for satellite positions, also allowing for decreased concentrations. We model velocities with the virial theorem and particle velocity distributions. Additionally, we introduce a velocity bias and a net infall velocity. We study how these choices impact the clustering statistics while keeping the number density and bias fixed to that from eBOSS ELGs. The projected correlation function, wp, captures most of the effects from the PDF and satellites profile. The quadrupole, ξ2, captures most of the effects coming from the velocity profile. We find that the impact of the mean HOD shape is subdominant relative to the rest of choices. We fit the clustering of the eBOSS DR16 ELG data under different combinations of the above assumptions. The catalogues presented here have been analysed in companion papers, showing that eBOSS RSD+BAO measurements are insensitive to the details of galaxy physics considered here. These catalogues are made publicly available.},

  abstract = {We develop a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) framework to study the clustering of cold dark matter (CDM) in cosmologies with massive neutrinos. We follow the trajectories of CDM particles with Lagrangian displacements fields up to third order in perturbation theory. Once the neutrinos become non-relativistic, their density fluctuations are modeled as being proportional to the CDM density fluctuations, with a scale-dependent proportionality factor. This yields a gravitational back-reaction that introduces additional scales to the linear growth function, which is accounted for in the higher order LPT kernels. Through non-linear mappings from Eulerian to Lagrangian frames, we ensure that our theory has a well behaved large scale behavior free of unwanted UV divergences, which are common when neutrino and CDM densities are not treated on an equal footing, and in resummation schemes that manifestly break Galilean invariance. We use our theory to construct correlation functions for both the underlying matter field, as well as for biased tracers using Convolution-LPT. Redshift-space distortions effects are modeled using the Gaussian Streaming Model. When comparing our analytical results to simulated data from the \textbackslash textsc\{Quijote\} simulation suite, we find good accuracy down to r=20 Mpc h-1 at redshift z=0.5, for the real space and redshift space monopole particle correlation functions with no free parameters. The same accuracy is reached for the redshift space quadrupole if we additionally consider an effective field theory parameter that shifts the pairwise velocity dispersion. For modeling the correlation functions of tracers we adopt a simple Lagrangian biasing scheme with only density and curvature operators, which we find sufficient to reach down to r=20 Mpc h-1 when comparing to simulated halos.},

The South Pole Telescope (SPT) 2540 \$\textbackslash text\{deg\}\^2\$ SPT-SZ survey offers measurements on sub-degree angular scales (multipoles \$650 \textbackslash leq \textbackslash ell \textbackslash leq 2500\$) with sufficient precision to use as an independent check of the Planck data. Here we build on the recent joint analysis of the SPT-SZ and Planck data in \textbackslash citet\{hou17\} by comparing LCDM parameter estimates using the temperature power spectrum from both data sets in the SPT-SZ survey region. We also restrict the multipole range used in parameter fitting to focus on modes measured well by both SPT and Planck, thereby greatly reducing sample variance as a driver of parameter differences and creating a stringent test for systematic errors. We find no evidence of systematic errors from such tests. When we expand the maximum multipole of SPT data used, we see low-significance shifts in the angular scale of the sound horizon and the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities, with a resulting trend to higher Hubble constant. When we compare SPT and Planck data on the SPT-SZ sky patch to Planck full-sky data but keep the multipole range restricted, we find differences in the parameters \$n\_s\$ and \$A\_se\^\{-2\textbackslash tau\}\$. We perform further checks, investigating instrumental effects and modeling assumptions, and we find no evidence that the effects investigated are responsible for any of the parameter shifts. Taken together, these tests reveal no evidence for systematic errors in SPT or Planck data in the overlapping sky coverage and multipole range and, at most, weak evidence for a breakdown of LCDM or systematic errors influencing either the Planck data outside the SPT-SZ survey area or the SPT data at \$\textbackslash ell {$>$}2000\$.},

  abstract = {The physical scale corresponding to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the size of the sound horizon at recombination, is precisely determined by CMB experiments. Measuring the apparent size of the BAO scale imprinted in the clustering of galaxies gives us a direct estimate of the angular-diameter distance and the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift. The BAO feature is damped by non-linear structure formation, which reduces the precision with which we can infer the BAO scale from standard galaxy clustering analysis methods. Many methods to undo this damping via the so-called BAO reconstruction have so far been proposed; however, they all rely on backward modeling. In this paper, we present the first results of BAO inference from rest-frame halo catalogs using forward modeling combined with the EFT likelihood, in the case where the initial phases of the density field are fixed. We show that the remaining systematic bias is less than 2\% when we consider cutoff values of \$\textbackslash Lambda \textbackslash leq 0.25 \textbackslash,h\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for all halo samples considered, and below 1\% and consistent with zero for all but the most highly biased samples. We also demonstrate that, when compared to the standard power spectrum likelihood approach under the same assumption of fixed phases, the 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ errors associated to the field level inference of the BAO scale are 1.1 to 3.3 times smaller, depending on the value of the cutoff and the halo sample. Our analysis therefore unveils another promising feature of using field-level inference for high-precision cosmology},

  abstract = {We report a detection of the coherent distortion of faint galaxies arising from gravitational lensing by foreground structures. This `cosmic shear' is potentially the most direct measure of the mass power spectrum, as it is unaffected by poorly justified assumptions made concerning the biasing of the distribution. Our detection is based on an initial imaging study of 14 separated 8×16arcmin2 fields observed in good, homogeneous conditions with the prime focus EEV-CCD camera of the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope. We detect an rms shear of 1.6per cent in 8×8arcmin2 cells, with a significance of 3.4σ. We carefully justify this detection by quantifying various systematic effects and carrying out extensive simulations of the recovery of the shear signal from artificial images defined according to measured instrument characteristics. We also verify our detection by computing the cross-correlation between the shear in adjacent cells. Including (Gaussian) cosmic variance, we measure the shear variance to be (0.016)2+/-(0.012)2+/-(0.006)2, where these 1σ errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. Our measurements are consistent with the predictions of cluster-normalized cold dark matter (CDM) models (within 1σ) but a Cosmic Background Explorer normalized standard cold dark matter model is ruled out at the 3.0σ level. For the currently favoured ΛCDM model (with Ωm=0.3), our measurement provides a normalization of the mass power spectrum of σ8=1.5+/-0.5, fully consistent with that derived from cluster abundances. Our result demonstrates that ground-based telescopes can, with adequate care, be used to constrain the mass power spectrum on various scales. The present results are limited mainly by cosmic variance, which can be overcome in the near future with more observations.},

We identified multiple flux ratios whose correlations with luminosity are stronger than those of light curve shape and color, previously identified spectral feature ratios, or equivalent width measurements. In particular, the flux ratio R642/443 = F(642\textasciitilde nm) / F(443\textasciitilde nm) has a correlation of 0.95 with SN Ia absolute magnitudes. Using this single ratio as a correction factor produces a Hubble diagram with a residual scatter standard deviation of 0.125 ± 0.011 mag, compared with 0.161 ± 0.015 mag when fit with the SALT2 light curve shape and color parameters x1 and c. The ratio R642/443 is an effective correction factor for both extrinsic dust reddening and instrinsic variations such as those of SN 1991T-like and SN 1999aa-like SNe. When combined with broad-band color measurements, spectral flux ratios can standardize SN Ia magnitudes to \textasciitilde 0.12 mag. These are the first spectral metrics that give robust improvements over the standard normalization methods based upon light curve shape and color, and they provide among the lowest scatter Hubble diagrams ever published.

We use the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background measured over a wide range of l in the first flight of the MAXIMA balloon-borne experiment (MAXIMA-1) and the low-l results from the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer experiment. We find constraints on the total energy density of the universe, Ω=1.0+0.15-0.30, the physical density of baryons, Ωbh2=0.03+/-0.01, the physical density of cold dark matter, Ωcdmh2=0.2+0.2-0.1, and the spectral index of primordial scalar fluctuations, ns=1.08+/-0.1, all at the 95\% confidence level. By combining our results with measurements of high-redshift supernovae we constrain the value of the cosmological constant and the fractional amount of pressureless matter in the universe to 0.45{$<$}ΩΛ{$<$}0.75 and 0.25{$<$}Ωm{$<$}0.50, at the 95\% confidence level. Our results are consistent with a flat universe and the shape parameter deduced from large-scale structure, and in marginal agreement with the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis.},

  abstract = {The relation between the clustering properties of luminous matter in the form of galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution is of fundamental importance for the interpretation of ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys. The so-called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter density, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum or correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However, gravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus nonlocal in the Eulerian density field, even if this term is absent in the initial conditions (Lagrangian space). Because the term is quadratic, it contributes as a loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picture still applies on very large scales; however, it contributes at leading order to the bispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. Such a term could also be present in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal field. We measure the corresponding coupling strengths from the matter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a nonvanishing coefficient for the tidal tensor term. We find no scale dependence of the inferred bias parameters up to k˜0.1hMpc-1 and that the tidal effect is increasing with halo mass. While the local Lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our results than the local Eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidal tensor bias already in the initial conditions. We also find that the coefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from the theoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universal mass function. Both quadratic density and tidal tensor bias terms must be included in the modeling of galaxy clustering of current and future surveys if one wants to achieve the high precision cosmology promise of these data sets.},

The extensions considered vary the primordial helium abundance, the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, the sum of neutrino masses, the relativistic energy density and mass of a sterile neutrino, and the mean spatial curvature. We do not find clear evidence for any of these extensions, from either the SPT-3G 2018 dataset alone or in combination with baryon acoustic oscillation and \textbackslash textit\{Planck\} data. None of these model extensions significantly relax the tension between Hubble-constant, \$H\_0\$, constraints from the CMB and from distance-ladder measurements using Cepheids and supernovae. The addition of the SPT-3G 2018 data to \textbackslash textit\{Planck\} reduces the square-root of the determinants of the parameter covariance matrices by factors of \$1.3 - 2.0\$ across these models, signaling a substantial reduction in the allowed parameter volume. We also explore CMB-based constraints on \$H\_0\$ from combined SPT, \textbackslash textit\{Planck\}, and ACT DR4 datasets. While individual experiments see some indications of different \$H\_0\$ values between the \$TT\$, \$TE\$, and \$EE\$ spectra, the combined \$H\_0\$ constraints are consistent between the three spectra. For the full combined datasets, we report \$H\_0 = 67.49 \textbackslash pm 0.53\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{km\textbackslash,s\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$, which is the tightest constraint on \$H\_0\$ from CMB power spectra to date and in \$4.1\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$ tension with the most precise distance-ladder-based measurement of \$H\_0\$. The SPT-3G survey is planned to continue through at least 2023, with existing maps of combined 2019 and 2020 data already having \$\textbackslash sim3.5\textbackslash times\$ lower noise than the maps used in this analysis.},

We highlight and investigate a problem that occurs in the log-normal case when the field is filtered, and we identify a regime where this approximation still holds. However, we show that the filtering is unnecessary if aliasing effects are taken into account and the discrete sampling step is carefully controlled. In this way we demonstrate a sub-percent precision of all our spectra up to the Nyquist frequency. We extend the method to generate a full light cone evolution, comparing two methods for this process, and validate our method with a tomographic analysis. We analytically and numerically investigate the structure of the covariance matrices obtained with such simulations which may be useful for future large and deep surveys.},

This change fosters the development of data-driven science as a useful companion to the common model-driven data analysis paradigm, where astronomers develop automatic tools to mine datasets and extract novel information from them. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers, and are now used for a wide variety of tasks. In light of these developments, and the promise and challenges associated with them, the IAC Winter School 2018 focused on big data in Astronomy, with a particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This document summarizes the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms presented during the school, and provides practical information on the application of such tools to astronomical datasets. In this document I cover basic topics in supervised machine learning, including selection and preprocessing of the input dataset, evaluation methods, and three popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and shallow Artificial Neural Networks. My main focus is on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, that are used to perform cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and outlier detection. Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular importance to scientific research, since they can be used to extract new knowledge from existing datasets, and can facilitate new discoveries.},

  abstract = {This paper presents stellar mass functions and i-band luminosity functions for Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies at \$i {$<$} 21\$ using clustering redshifts, from which we also compute targeting completeness measurements for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Clustering redshifts is a method of obtaining the redshift distribution of a sample of galaxies with only photometric information by measuring the angular crosscorrelation with a spectroscopic sample in different redshift bins. We construct a spectroscopic sample containing data from the BOSS + eBOSS surveys, allowing us to recover redshift distributions from photometric data out to \$z\textbackslash simeq 2.5\$. We produce k-corrected i-band luminosity functions and stellar mass functions by applying clustering redshifts to SDSS DR8 galaxies in small bins of colour and magnitude. There is little evolution in the mass function between \$0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.8\$, implying the most massive galaxies form most of their mass before \$z = 0.8\$. These mass functions are used to produce stellar mass completeness estimates for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), giving a stellar mass completeness of \$80\textbackslash\%\$ above \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\} {$>$} 10\^\{11.4\}\$ between \$0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7\$, with completeness falling significantly at redshifts higher than 0.7, and at lower masses. Large photometric datasets will be available in the near future (DECaLS, DES, Euclid), so this, and similar techniques will become increasingly useful in order to fully utilise this data.},

  abstract = {We discuss the detection of large-scale H I intensity fluctuations using a single dish approach with the ultimate objective of measuring the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and constraining the properties of dark energy. To characterize the signal we present 3D power spectra, 2D angular power spectra for individual redshift slices and also individual line-of-sight spectra computed using the S3 simulated H I catalogue which is based on the Millennium Simulation. We consider optimal instrument design and survey strategies for a single dish observation at low and high redshift for a fixed sensitivity. For a survey corresponding to an instrument with Tsys = 50 K, 50 feedhorns and 1 year of observations, we find that at low redshift (z ≈ 0.3), a resolution of ˜40 arcmin and a survey of ˜5000 deg2 is close to optimal, whereas at higher redshift (z ≈ 0.9) a resolution of ˜10 arcmin and ˜500 deg2 would be necessary - something which would be difficult to achieve cheaply using a single dish. Continuum foreground emission from the Galaxy and extragalactic radio sources are potentially a problem. In particular, we suggest that it could be that the dominant extragalactic foreground comes from the clustering of very weak sources. We assess its amplitude and discuss ways by which it might be mitigated. We then introduce our concept for a dedicated single dish telescope designed to detect BAO at low redshifts. It involves an underillumintated static ˜40 m dish and a ˜60 element receiver array held ˜90 m above the underilluminated dish. Correlation receivers will be used with each main science beam referenced against an antenna pointing at one of the celestial poles for stability and control of systematics. We make sensitivity estimates for our proposed system and projections for the uncertainties on the power spectrum after 1 year of observations. We find that it is possible to measure the acoustic scale at z ≈ 0.3 with an accuracy ˜2.4 per cent and that w can be measured to an accuracy of 16 per cent.},

Using instruments with \textasciitilde 5-10 arcmin resolution currently in the planning stage, it should be possible to detect virialized galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts using the combined emission from their constituent galaxies, as well as less overdense structures, such as protoclusters and the `cosmic web', at higher redshifts. Using semi-analytic methods, we compute the number of virialized objects and those at turnaround which might be detected by such surveys. We find that there is a surprisingly large number of objects even using small (\textasciitilde 5 per cent) bandwidths and elaborate on some issues pertinent to optimizing the design of the instrument and the survey strategy. The main uncertainty is the fraction of neutral gas relative to the total dark matter within the object. We discuss this issue in the context of the observations which are currently available.},

  abstract = {The existence of the cosmic neutrino background is a robust prediction of the hot big bang model. These neutrinos were a dominant component of the energy density in the early Universe and therefore played an important role in the evolution of cosmological perturbations. The energy density of the cosmic neutrino background has been measured using the abundances of light elements and the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. A complementary and more robust probe is provided by a distinct shift in the temporal phase of sound waves in the primordial plasma that is produced by fluctuations in the neutrino density. Here, we report on the first constraint on this neutrino-induced phase shift in the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations of the BOSS DR12 data. Constraining the acoustic scale using Planck data while marginalizing over the effects of neutrinos in the cosmic microwave background, we find a non-zero phase shift at greater than 95\% confidence. Besides providing a new test of the cosmic neutrino background, our work is the first application of the baryon acoustic oscillation signal to early Universe physics. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present a study on the robustness of the covariance matrix estimation for galaxy clustering measurements depending on the cosmological parameters and galaxy bias. To this end, we have produced 9000 galaxy mock catalogues relying on the effective Zel'dovich approximation implemented in the EZmock computer code, using different input cosmological models and bias parameters. The reference catalogue has also been produced with this code, making our study insensitive to the approximation, at least on a relative-qualitative level. Our findings indicate that the covariance matrix is insensitive to the input power spectrum (e.g. different σ\textsubscript{8}), as long as the two- and three-point galaxy clustering measurements agree with the given data. In fact, the covariance matrix shows a bias at small scales (r≲ 40 h\^\{-1\} Mpc) when the chosen galaxy bias parameters yield three-point statistics, which is not compatible with the reference one within the error bars, even though the two-point statistics agree within 1 per cent. Nevertheless, the error becomes negligible at large scales, making the covariance matrix still reliable for data analysis using only measurements in that regime (e.g. measuring baryon acoustic oscillations). High precision in cosmological parameter estimation is expected for covariance matrices extracted from mock galaxy catalogues, which accurately take into account both the two- and three-point statistics. This is independent of whether this is achieved by using the right cosmology and galaxy bias (which are not a priori known) or just any combination of both fitting the net observed galaxy clustering.},

This sample consists of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) spanning the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} \$z\$ {$<$} 1, at an effective redshift of \$z\$ eff = 0.698. It combines 174 816 eBOSS and 202 642 BOSS LRGs. We extract and model the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) features from the galaxy two-point correlation function to infer geometrical and dynamical cosmological constraints. The adopted methodology is extensively tested on a set of realistic simulations. The correlations between the inferred parameters from the BAO and full-shape correlation function analyses are estimated. This allows us to derive joint constraints on the three cosmological parameter combinations: DM( \$z\$ )/rd, DH( \$z\$ )/rd, and fσ8( \$z\$ ), where DM is the comoving angular diameter distance, DH is the Hubble distance, rd is the comoving BAO scale, f is the linear growth rate of structure, and σ8 is the amplitude of linear matter perturbations. After combining the results with those from the parallel power spectrum analysis of Gil-Marin et al., we obtain the constraints: DM/rd = 17.65 ± 0.30, DH/rd = 19.77 ± 0.47, and fσ8 = 0.473 ± 0.044.

The study uses spectra of 157 783 quasars in the redshift range 2.1 ≤ z ≤ 3.5 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 12 (DR12). Besides the statistical improvements on our previous studies using SDSS DR9 and DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements in the analysis procedure, allowing us to construct a physical model of the correlation function and to investigate potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. The Hubble distance, DH = c/H(z), relative to the sound horizon is DH(z = 2.33) /rd = 9.07 ± 0.31. The best-determined combination of comoving angular-diameter distance, DM, and the Hubble distance is found to be DH0.7DM0.3 /rd = 13.94 ± 0.35. This value is 1.028 ± 0.026 times the prediction of the flat-ΛCDM model consistent with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. The errors include marginalization over the effects of unidentified high-density absorption systems and fluctuations in ultraviolet ionizing radiation. Independently of the CMB measurements, the combination of our results and other BAO observations determine the open-ΛCDM density parameters to be ΩM = 0.296 ± 0.029, ΩΛ = 0.699 ± 0.100 and Ωk = -0.002 ± 0.119.},

By combining these galaxies with the high-redshift tail of the BOSS galaxy sample, we form a sample of LRGs at an effective redshift z = 0.72, covering an effective volume of 0.9 Gpc 3 . We account for spurious fluctuations caused by targeting and by redshift failures, which were validated on a set of mock catalogs. This analysis is sufficient to provide a 2.5\% measurement of spherically averaged baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/863/1/110/apjaacea5ieqn1.gif] \$D\_V(z=0.72)=2377\_-59\^+61(r\_d/r\_d,\textbackslash mathrmfid)\$ Mpc, at 2.8 σ of significance. Together with the recent quasar-based BAO measurement at z = 1.5 and forthcoming emission line galaxy–based measurements, this measurement demonstrates that eBOSS is fulfilling its remit of extending the range of redshifts covered by such measurements, laying the groundwork for forthcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey and Euclid.},

  abstract = {Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of cosmic structure on small, non-linear, scales. It is thus often proposed that using statistics beyond the power spectrum can tighten constraints on the neutrino mass by extracting additional information from these non-linear scales. We study the information content regarding neutrino mass at the field level, quantifying how much of this information arises from the difference in non-linear evolution between a cosmology with 1 fluid (CDM) and 2 fluids (CDM + neutrinos). We do so by running two \$N\$-body simulations, one with and one without massive neutrinos; both with the same phases, and matching their linear power spectrum at a given, low, redshift. This effectively isolates the information encoded in the linear initial conditions from the non-linear cosmic evolution. We demonstrate that for \$k \textbackslash lesssim 1\textbackslash,h/\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$, and for a single redshift, there is negligible difference in the real-space CDM field between the two simulations. This suggests that all the information regarding neutrinos is in the linear power spectrum set by the initial conditions. Thus any probe based on the CDM field alone will have negligible constraining power beyond that which exists at the linear level over the same range of scales. Consequently, any probe based on the halo field will contain little information beyond the linear power. We find similar results for the matter field responsible for weak lensing. We also demonstrate that there may be much information beyond the power spectrum in the 3d matter field, however, this is not observable in modern surveys via dark matter halos or weak lensing. Finally, we show that there is additional information to be found in redshift space.},

  abstract = {Photometric galaxy surveys probe the late-time Universe where the density field is highly non-Gaussian. A consequence is the emergence of the super-sample covariance (SSC), a non-Gaussian covariance term that is sensitive to fluctuations on scales larger than the survey window. In this work, we study the impact of the survey geometry on the SSC and, subsequently, on cosmological parameter inference. We devise a fast SSC approximation that accounts for the survey geometry and compare its performance to the common approximation of rescaling the results by the fraction of the sky covered by the survey, \$f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{SKY\}\$, dubbed 'full-sky approximation'. To gauge the impact of our new SSC recipe, dubbed 'partial-sky', we perform Fisher forecasts on the parameters of the \$(w\_0,w\_a)\$-CDM model in a 3x2 points analysis, varying the survey area, the geometry of the mask and the galaxy distribution inside our redshift bins. The differences in the marginalised forecast errors, with the full-sky approximation performing poorly for small survey areas but excellently for stage-IV-like areas, are found to be absorbed by the marginalisation on galaxy bias nuisance parameters. For large survey areas, the unmarginalised errors are underestimated by about 10\% for all probes considered. This is a hint that, even for stage-IV-like surveys, the partial-sky method introduced in this work will be necessary if tight priors are applied on these nuisance parameters.},

We use these new data in combination with Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements from 42 quasars at 4.5 ≤ zem ≤ 6.4 to conduct an updated analysis of the line-of-sight variance in the intergalactic Ly$\alpha$ opacity over 4 ≤ z ≤ 6. We find that the scatter in transmission among lines of sight near z ˜ 6 significantly exceeds theoretical expectations for either a uniform ultraviolet background (UVB) or simple fluctuating UVB models in which the mean free path to ionizing photons is spatially invariant. The data, particularly near z ≃ 5.6-5.8, instead require fluctuations in the volume-weighted hydrogen neutral fraction that are a factor of 3 or more beyond those expected from density variations alone. We argue that these fluctuations are most likely driven by large-scale variations in the mean free path, consistent with expectations for the final stages of inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization. Even by z ≃ 5.6, however, a large fraction of the data are consistent with a uniform UVB, and by z ˜ 5 the data are fully consistent with opacity fluctuations arising solely from the density field. This suggests that while reionization may be ongoing at z ˜ 6, it has fully completed by z ˜ 5.},

We exploit the general lack of evolution in the mean quasar continuum to avoid the bias introduced by continuum fitting over the Ly$\alpha$ forest at high redshifts, which has been the primary systematic uncertainty in previous measurements of the mean Ly$\alpha$ transmission. The individual spectra are first combined into 26 composites with mean redshifts spanning 2.25 ≤ zcomp ≤ 5.08. The flux ratios of separate composites at the same rest wavelength are then used, without continuum fitting, to infer the mean transmitted flux, F(z), as a fraction of its value at z ˜ 2. Absolute values for F(z) are found by scaling our relative values to measurements made from high-resolution data by Faucher-Giguère et al. at z ≤ 2.5, where continuum uncertainties are minimal. We find that F(z) evolves smoothly with redshift, with no evidence of a previously reported feature at z ≃ 3.2. This trend is consistent with a gradual evolution of the ionization and thermal state of the intergalactic medium over 2 {$<$} z {$<$} 5. Our results generally agree with the most careful measurements to date made from high-resolution data, but offer much greater precision and extend to higher redshifts. This work also improves upon previous efforts using SDSS spectra by significantly reducing the level of systematic errors.},

  abstract = {We analyse the clustering of matter on large scales in an extension of the concordance model that allows for spatial curvature. We develop a consistent approach to curvature and wide-angle effects on the galaxy 2-point correlation function in redshift space. In particular we derive the Alcock-Paczynski distortion of \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}\$, which differs significantly from empirical models in the literature. A key innovation is the use of the `Clustering Ratio', which probes clustering in a different way to redshift-space distortions, so that their combination delivers more powerful cosmological constraints. We use this combination to constrain cosmological parameters, without CMB information. In a curved Universe, we find that \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\{\textbackslash rm m\}, 0\}=0.26\textbackslash pm 0.04\$ (68\textbackslash\% CL). When the clustering probes are combined with low-redshift background probes -- BAO and SNIa -- we obtain the first CMB-independent constraint on curvature: \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{K,0\}=0.0041\textbackslash,\_\{-0.0504\}\^\{+0.0500\}\$. We find no Bayesian evidence that the flat concordance model can be rejected. In addition we show that the sound horizon at decoupling is \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm d\} = 144.57 \textbackslash pm 2.34 \textbackslash; \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$, in agreement with its measurement from CMB anisotropies. As a consequence, the late-time Universe is compatible with flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM and a standard sound horizon, leading to a small value of \$H\_\{0\}\$, \{\textbackslash em without\} assuming any CMB information. Clustering Ratio measurements produce the only low-redshift clustering data set that is not in disagreement with the CMB, and combining the two data sets we obtain \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{K,0\}= -0.023 \textbackslash pm 0.010\$.},

It is interesting to compare these local measurements with global fits to data from cosmic microwave background anisotropies.

  abstract = {Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) provide a "standard ruler" of known  physical length, making it one of the most promising probes of the nature of dark energy (DE). The detection of BAOs as an excess of power in the galaxy distribution at a certain scale requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. "Transversal" (or "angular") BAOs measure the angular size of this scale projected in the sky and provide information about the angular distance. "Line-of-sight" (or "radial") BAOs require very precise redshifts, but provide a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, a more sensitive probe of DE. The main goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to obtain photometric redshifts with enough precision (σ z ) to measure BAOs along the line of sight. There is a fundamental limitation as to how much one can improve the BAO measurement by reducing σ z . We show that σ z \textasciitilde{} 0.003(1 + z) is sufficient: a much better precision will produce an oversampling of the BAO peak without a significant improvement on its detection, while a much worse precision will result in the effective loss of the radial information. This precision in redshift can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, featuring a prominent 4000 Å break, by using a filter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width close to 100 Å, covering the wavelength range from \textasciitilde 4000 to \textasciitilde 8000 Å, supplemented by two broad-band filters similar to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey u and z bands. We describe the practical implementation of this idea, a new galaxy survey project, PAU16Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU): http://www.ice.cat/pau., to be carried out with a telescope/camera combination with an etendue about 20 m2 deg2, equivalent to a 2 m telescope equipped with a 6 deg2 field of view camera, and covering 8000 deg2 in the sky in four years. We expect to measure positions and redshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with L {$>$} L sstarf and iAB lsim 22.5 in the redshift interval 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.9, with a precision σ z {$<$} 0.003(1 + z). This population has a number density n gsim 10-3 Mpc-3 h 3 galaxies within the 9 Gpc3 h -3 volume to be sampled by our survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the BAO scale is not limited by shot noise. By itself, such a survey will deliver precisions of order 5\% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, if assumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined with future cosmic microwave background measurements. In addition, PAU will yield high-quality redshift and low-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies, including a very significant high-redshift population. The data set produced by this survey will have a unique legacy value, allowing a wide range of astrophysical studies.},

  abstract = {We present the final nine-year maps and basic results from the Wilkinson  Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission. The full nine-year analysis of the time-ordered data provides updated characterizations and calibrations of the experiment. We also provide new nine-year full sky temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to separate cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from foreground emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new foreground-reduced CMB maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C -1 weighting to compute the temperature angular power spectrum. The WMAP mission has resulted in a highly constrained ΛCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant measurements, we find that big bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species (N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is t 0 = 13.772 ± 0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H 0 = 69.32 ± 0.80 km s-1 Mpc-1. Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity, reported earlier by the WMAP team, now has high statistical significance (ns = 0.9608 ± 0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean (\textbackslash Omega \_k = -0.0027\^\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{-0.0038\}). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the standard six-parameter ΛCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness of fit, the inflationary flat ΛCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

  abstract = {An imaging survey of the field around QSO PKS 2128-12, a QSO with low  redshift narrow Mg II absorption line systems, is performed to verify the assumption that sharp metal-rich absorption systems found in the spectra of QSO's arise in intervening materials. The absorber has a redshift, z = 0.4299, that is smaller than that of the QSO emission redshift. The closest galaxy to the QSO, lies 64 kpc north-east of it, and has a redshift equal to that of the absorber. It is gas-rich, and its V and red magnitudes are about those expected for a spiral galaxy. Since the absorbing gas is found to have a small velocity dispersion, fairly high abundances and column densities, and a moderate degree of ionization, it is more likely associated with material in the disc of this galaxy than with a large surrounding halo. This QSO-galaxy pair increases by a factor of four the projected distance from a galaxy center at which absorbing ionized gas has been detected, strongly favoring the assumption of intervening galaxies at least for moderately ionized absorbers.},

  abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the bias between galaxies and dark matter by specifying (1) the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class and (2) the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. We calculate and compare the HODs predicted by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation of a ΛCDM cosmological model (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant) and by a semianalytic galaxy formation model applied to the same cosmology. Although the two methods predict different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions for samples of the same space density agree remarkably well. In a sample defined by a baryonic mass threshold, the mean occupation function M exhibits a sharp cutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau in which climbs from 1 to 2 over nearly a decade in halo mass, and a more steeply rising high-occupancy regime at high halo mass. In the low-occupancy regime, the factorial moments and are well below the values of 2 and 3 expected for Poisson statistics, with important consequences for the small-scale behavior of the two- and three-point correlation functions. The HOD depends strongly on galaxy age, with high-mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies and low-mass halos by young galaxies. The distribution of galaxies within SPH halos supports the assumptions usually made in semianalytic calculations: the most massive galaxy lies close to the halo center and moves near the halo's mean velocity, while the remaining, satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the dark matter. The mean occupation at fixed halo mass in the SPH simulation is independent of the halo's larger scale environment, supporting both the merger tree approach of the semianalytic method and the claim that the HOD provides a complete statistical characterization of galaxy bias. We discuss the connections between the predicted HODs and the galaxy formation physics incorporated in the SPH and semianalytic approaches. These predictions offer useful guidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be tested empirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys. By applying the HODs to a large-volume N-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight departures from a power-law galaxy correlation function, similar to features detected in recent observational analyses.},

  abstract = {Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler, and can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe at low redshift. Standard BAO analyses return a model-independent measurement of the expansion rate and the comoving angular diameter distance as function of redshift, normalized by the sound horizon at radiation drag. However, this methodology relies on anisotropic distance distortions of a fixed, pre-computed template (obtained in a given fiducial cosmology) in order to fit the observations. Therefore, it may be possible that extensions to the consensus \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM add contributions to the BAO feature that cannot be captured by the template fitting. We perform mock BAO fits to power spectra computed assuming cosmological models which modify the growth of perturbations prior to recombination in order to test the robustness of the standard BAO analysis. We find no significant bias in the BAO analysis for the models under study (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM with a free effective number of relativistic species, early dark energy, and a model with interactions between neutrinos and a fraction of the dark matter), even for cases which do not provide a good fit to \textbackslash textit\{Planck\} measurements of the cosmic microwave background power spectra. This result supports the use of the standard BAO analysis and its measurements to perform cosmological parameter inference and to constrain exotic models. In addition, we provide a methodology to reproduce our study for different models and surveys, as well as discuss different options to handle eventual biases in the BAO measurements.},

We first discuss the dynamics of gravitational instability, from the linear to the non-linear regime. This includes Eulerian and Lagrangian PT, non-linear approximations, and a brief description of numerical simulation techniques. We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlations functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.},

In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

  abstract = {Aims: We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis  of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples (z{$<$} 0.1), all three seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 Methods: We followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS three-year data analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 SNe); 2) intercalibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light curves. Results: We produce recalibrated SN Ia light curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat ΛCDM cosmology, we find Ωm =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8σ (stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS three-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 ± 0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe.

  abstract = {We analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey  (6dFGS) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal at 105 h-1 Mpc. The 6dFGS BAO detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at zeff= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of DV(zeff) = 457 ± 27 Mpc and a measurement of the distance ratio, rs(zd)/DV(zeff) = 0.336 ± 0.015 (4.5 per cent precision), where rs(zd) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch zd. The low-effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble constant. We find a Hubble constant of H0= 67 ± 3.2 km s-1 Mpc-1 (4.8 per cent precision) that depends only on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe-7 (WMAP-7) calibration of the sound horizon and on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to H0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state parameter w and H0 in the cosmic microwave background data. We determine that w=-0.97 ± 0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and Percival et al. (2010). We also discuss predictions for the large-scale correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the Wide field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) blind H I survey (with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope. We find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak, making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3 per cent precision.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of redshift-space distortions in the two-point correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). The K-band selected sub-sample which we employ in this study contains 81971 galaxies distributed over 17000deg\^2 with an effective redshift z = 0.067. By modelling the 2D galaxy correlation function, xi(r\_p,pi), we measure the parameter combination f(z)sigma\_8(z) = 0.423 +/- 0.055. Alternatively, by assuming standard gravity we can break the degeneracy between sigma\_8 and the galaxy bias parameter, b. Combining our data with the Hubble constant prior from Riess et al (2011), we measure sigma\_8 = 0.76 +/- 0.11 and Omega\_m = 0.250 +/- 0.022, consistent with constraints from other galaxy surveys and the Cosmic Microwave Background data from WMAP7. Combining our measurement of fsigma\_8 with WMAP7 allows us to test the relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constraining the growth index of density fluctuations, gamma. Using only 6dFGS and WMAP7 data we find gamma = 0.547 +/- 0.088, consistent with the prediction of General Relativity. We note that because of the low effective redshift of 6dFGS our measurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmological model (Alcock-Paczynski effect). We also show that our conclusions are not sensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. Using a Fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fsigma\_8 for the WALLABY survey and the proposed TAIPAN survey. The WALLABY survey will be able to measure fsigma\_8 with a precision of 4-10\%, depending on the modelling of non-linear structure formation. This is comparable to the predicted precision for the best redshift bins of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant role to play in future tests of dark energy and modified gravity.},

We calculate the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions in the overlap region of the two data sets and detect a Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal in each of them. The BAO measurement from the cross-correlation function represents the first such detection between two different galaxy surveys. After applying density-field reconstruction we report distance-scale measurements D\_V r\_s\^fid / r\_s = (1970 ± 45, 2132 ± 65, 2100 ± 200) Mpc from CMASS, the cross-correlation and WiggleZ, respectively. The distance scales derived from the two data sets are consistent, and are also robust against switching the displacement fields used for reconstruction between the two surveys. We use correlated mock realizations to calculate the covariance between the three BAO constraints. This approach can be used to construct a correlation matrix, permitting for the first time a rigorous combination of WiggleZ and CMASS BAO measurements. Using a volume-scaling technique, our result can also be used to combine WiggleZ and future CMASS DR12 results. Finally, we show that the relative velocity effect, a possible source of systematic uncertainty for the BAO technique, is consistent with zero for our samples.},

We analyse this data set in Fourier space, using the power-spectrum multipoles to measure redshift-space distortions simultaneously with the Alcock-Paczynski effect and the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. We include the power-spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole in our analysis and compare our measurements with a perturbation-theory-based model, while properly accounting for the survey window function. To evaluate the reliability of our analysis pipeline, we participate in a mock challenge, which results in systematic uncertainties significantly smaller than the statistical uncertainties. While the high-redshift constraint on fσ8 at zeff = 0.61 indicates a small (˜1.4σ) deviation from the prediction of the Planck ΛCDM (Λ cold dark matter) model, the low-redshift constraint is in good agreement with Planck ΛCDM. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering data set from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al. to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

We perform our analysis in Fourier space using a power spectrum estimator suggested by Yamamoto et al. (2006). We measure the multipole power spectra in a self-consistent manner for the first time in the sense that we provide a proper way to treat the survey window function and the integral constraint, without the commonly used assumption of an isotropic power spectrum and without the need to split the survey into sub-regions. The main cosmological signals exploited in our analysis are the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the signal of redshift space distortions, both of which are distorted by the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Together, these signals allow us to constrain the distance ratio \$D\_V(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_s(z\_d) = 13.89\textbackslash pm 0.18\$, the Alcock-Paczynski parameter \$F\_\{\textbackslash rm AP\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}) = 0.679\textbackslash pm0.031\$ and the growth rate of structure \$f(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})\textbackslash sigma\_8(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}) = 0.419\textbackslash pm0.044\$ at the effective redshift \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=0.57\$. We did not find significant systematic uncertainties for \$D\_V/r\_s\$ or \$F\_\{\textbackslash rm AP\}\$ but include a systematic error for \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ of \$3.1\textbackslash\%\$. Combining our dataset with Planck to test General Relativity (GR) through the simple \$\textbackslash gamma\$-parameterisation, reveals a \$\textbackslash sim 2\textbackslash sigma\$ tension between the data and the prediction by GR.

Combining our cosmological constraints with 9-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9) yields ∑m\textsubscript{ν} = 0.36 ± 0.14 eV (68 per cent c.l.), which represents a 2.6σ preference for non-zero neutrino mass. The significance can be increased to 3.3σ when including weak lensing results and other BAO constraints, yielding ∑m\textsubscript{ν} = 0.35 ± 0.10 eV (68 per cent c.l.). However, combining CMASS with Planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to ̃2σ. When removing the CMB lensing effect in the Planck temperature power spectrum (by marginalizing over A\textsubscript{L}), we see shifts of ̃1σ in σ\textsubscript{8} and Ω\textsubscript{m}, which have a significant effect on the neutrino mass constraints. In the case of CMASS plus Planck without the A\textsubscript{L} lensing signal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of ∑m\textsubscript{ν} = 0.34 ± 0.14 eV (68 per cent c.l.), in excellent agreement with the WMAP9+CMASS value.

The relative velocity effect is sourced by the different evolution of baryon and cold dark matter perturbations before decoupling. Our power spectrum model includes all one-loop redshift-space terms corresponding to v\textsubscript{bc} parametrized by the bias parameter b\textsubscript{v}\textsuperscript{2}.

Our data does not support a detection of the relative velocity effect in any of these parameters.

As an alternative to the standard analysis, the deconvolved power spectrum multipoles can be used to perform a data analysis agnostic of survey specific aspects, like the window function. We show that in the case of the BOSS dataset, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) analysis using the deconvolved power spectra results in the same likelihood as the standard analysis. To facilitate the analysis based on both the convolved and deconvolved power spectrum measurements, we provide the window function matrices, wide-angle matrices, covariance matrices and the power spectrum multipole measurements for the datasets mentioned above. Together with this paper we publish a \textbackslash code\{Python\}-based toolbox to calculate the different analysis components.

This holds the possibility of a new tool for studying the universe at high-z, using the mean brightness temperature to probe the HI content and its fluctuations to probe power spectrum. Existing estimates of the HI density atz−3 imply a mean brightness temperature of 1 mK at 320 MHz. The cross-correlation between the temperature fluctuation across different frequencies and sight lines is predicted to vary from 10−7 K2 to 10−8 K2 over intervals corresponding to spatial scales from 10 Mpc to 40 Mpc for some of the currently favoured cosmological models. Comparing this with the expected sensitivity of the GMRT, we find that this can be detected with ∼ 10 hrs of integration, provided we can distinguish it from the galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which will swamp this signal. We discuss a strategy based on the very distinct spectral properties of the foregrounds as against the HI emission, possibly allowing the removal of the foregrounds from the observed maps.},

  abstract = {Upcoming imaging surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will repeatedly scan large areas of sky and have the potential to yield million-supernova catalogs. Type Ia supernovae are excellent standard candles and will provide distance measures that suffice to detect mean pairwise velocities of their host galaxies. We show that when combining these distance measures with photometric redshifts for either the supernovae or their host galaxies, the mean pairwise velocities of the host galaxies will provide a dark energy probe which is competitive with other widely discussed methods. Adding information from this test to type Ia supernova photometric luminosity distances from the same experiment, plus the cosmic microwave background power spectrum from the Planck satellite, improves the Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit by a factor of 1.8. Pairwise velocity measurements require no additional observational effort beyond that required to perform the traditional supernova luminosity distance test, but may provide complementary constraints on dark energy parameters and the nature of gravity. Incorporating additional spectroscopic redshift follow-up observations could provide important dark energy constraints from pairwise velocities alone. Mean pairwise velocities are much less sensitive to systematic redshift errors than the luminosity distance test or weak lensing techniques, and also are only mildly affected by systematic evolution of supernova luminosity.},

  abstract = {Observed galaxy clustering exhibits local transverse statistical isotropy around the line of sight (LOS). The variation of the LOS across a galaxy survey complicates the measurement of the observed clustering as a function of the angle to the LOS, as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) based on Cartesian grids, cannot individually allow for this. Recent advances in methodology for calculating LOS-dependent clustering in Fourier space include the realization that power spectrum LOS-dependent moments can be constructed from sums over galaxies, based on approximating the LOS to each pair of galaxies by the LOS to one of them. We show that we can implement this method using multiple FFTs, each measuring the LOS-weighted clustering along different axes. The Nlog N nature of FFTs means that the computational speed-up is a factor of {$>$}1000 compared with summing over galaxies. This development should be beneficial for future projects such as DESI and Euclid which will provide an order of magnitude more galaxies than current surveys.},

We fit a flat ΛCDM model to the reconstructed lensing power spectrum alone and in addition with other data sets: baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), as well as primary CMB spectra from Planck and SPTpol. The cosmological constraints based on SPTpol and Planck lensing band powers are in good agreement when analyzed alone and in combination with Planck full-sky primary CMB data. With weak priors on the baryon density and other parameters, the SPTpol CMB lensing data alone provide a 4\% constraint on . Jointly fitting with BAO data, we find , , and , up to away from the central values preferred by Planck lensing + BAO. However, we recover good agreement between SPTpol and Planck when restricting the analysis to similar scales. We also consider single-parameter extensions to the flat ΛCDM model. The SPTpol lensing spectrum constrains the spatial curvature to be and the sum of the neutrino masses to be eV at 95\% C.L.

  abstract = {In order to be efficient, spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys do not obtain redshifts for all galaxies in the population targeted. The missing galaxies are often clustered, commonly leading to a lower proportion of successful observations in dense regions. One example is the close-pair issue for SDSS spectroscopic galaxy surveys, which have a deficit of pairs of observed galaxies with angular separation closer than the hardware limit on placing neighbouring fibres. Spatially clustered missing observations will exist in the next generations of surveys. Various schemes have previously been suggested to mitigate these effects, but none works for all situations. We argue that the solution is to link the missing galaxies to those observed with statistically equivalent clustering properties, and that the best way to do this is to rerun the targeting algorithm, varying the angular position of the observations. Provided that every pair has a non-zero probability of being observed in one realization of the algorithm, then a pair-upweighting scheme linking targets to successful observations, can correct these issues. We present such a scheme, and demonstrate its validity using realizations of an idealized simple survey strategy. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, \$r\$, derived from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization \$B\$-modes with "delensing," whereby the uncertainty on \$r\$ contributed by the sample variance of the gravitational lensing \$B\$-modes is reduced by cross-correlating against a lensing \$B\$-mode template. This template is constructed by combining an estimate of the polarized CMB with a tracer of the projected large-scale structure. The large-scale-structure tracer used is a map of the cosmic infrared background derived from Planck satellite data, while the polarized CMB map comes from a combination of South Pole Telescope, BICEP/Keck, and Planck data. We expand the BICEP/Keck likelihood analysis framework to accept a lensing template and apply it to the BICEP/Keck data set collected through 2014 using the same parametric foreground modelling as in the previous analysis. From simulations, we find that the uncertainty on \$r\$ is reduced by \$\textbackslash sim10\textbackslash\%\$, from \$\textbackslash sigma(r)\$= 0.024 to 0.022, which can be compared with a \$\textbackslash sim26\textbackslash\%\$ reduction obtained when using a perfect lensing template. Applying the technique to the real data, the constraint on \$r\$ is improved from \$r\_\{0.05\} {$<$} 0.090\$ to \$r\_\{0.05\} {$<$} 0.082\$ (95\textbackslash\% C.L.). This is the first demonstration of improvement in an \$r\$ constraint through delensing.},

  abstract = {We report the results of a joint analysis of data from BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck. BICEP2 and Keck Array have observed the same approximately 400 deg\textsuperscript{2} patch of sky centered on RA 0 h, Dec. -57.5 ° . The combined maps reach a depth of 57 nK deg in Stokes Q and U in a band centered at 150 GHz. Planck has observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353 GHz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 μ K deg in Q and U at 143 GHz). We detect 150 ×353 cross-correlation in B modes at high significance. We fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra at frequencies ≥150 GHz to a lensed-Λ CDM model that includes dust and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r), using a prior on the frequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous Planck analysis of other regions of the sky. We find strong evidence for dust and no statistically significant evidence for tensor modes. We probe various model variations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component in combination with lower frequency data, and find that these make little difference to the r constraint. Finally, we present an alternative analysis which is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and show that this gives similar constraints. The final result is expressed as a likelihood curve for r, and yields an upper limit r\textsubscript{0.05}\&lt;0.12 at 95\% confidence. Marginalizing over dust and r, lensing B modes are detected at 7.0 σ significance. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We take auto and cross spectra between these maps and publicly available WMAP and Planck maps at frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz. We evaluate the joint likelihood of the spectra versus a multicomponent model of lensed-Λ CDM +r +dust+synchrotron+noise . The foreground model has seven parameters, and we impose priors on some of these using external information from Planck and WMAP derived from larger regions of sky. The model is shown to be an adequate description of the data at the current noise levels. The likelihood analysis yields the constraint r\textsubscript{0.05}\&lt;0.07 at 95\% confidence, which tightens to r\textsubscript{0.05}\&lt;0.06 in conjunction with Planck temperature measurements and other data. The lensing signal is detected at 8.8 σ significance. Running a maximum likelihood search on simulations we obtain unbiased results and find that σ (r )=0.020 . These are the strongest constraints to date on primordial gravitational waves. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present methods for interpolating between the 1-D flux power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, as output by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Interpolation is necessary for cosmological parameter estimation due to the limited number of simulations possible. We construct an emulator for the \textbackslash Lya forest flux power spectrum from 21 small simulations using Latin hypercube sampling and Gaussian process interpolation. We show that this emulator has a typical accuracy of 1.5\% and a worst-case accuracy of 4\%, which compares well to the current statistical error of 3-5\% at z \&lt; 3 from BOSS DR9. We compare to the previous state of the art, quadratic polynomial interpolation. The Latin hypercube samples the entire volume of parameter space, while quadratic polynomial emulation samples only lower-dimensional subspaces. The Gaussian process provides an estimate of the emulation error and we show using test simulations that this estimate is reasonable. We construct a likelihood function and use it to show that the posterior constraints generated using the emulator are unbiased. We show that our Gaussian process emulator has lower emulation error than quadratic polynomial interpolation and thus produces tighter posterior confidence intervals, which will be essential for future Lyman-$\alpha$ surveys such as DESI. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

The correct behaviour can be obtained without any loss of simulation resolution by using a Lagrangian glass for the baryon particles. We further show that the difference between cold dark matter and baryons may affect predictions for the Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum at the 5\% level, potentially impacting current cosmological constraints.},

  abstract = {The dominant uncertainty in the current measurement of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$) with strong gravitational lensing time delays is attributed to uncertainties in the mass profiles of the main deflector galaxies. Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) can provide, in addition to measurable time delays, lensing magnification constraints when knowledge about the unlensed apparent brightness of the explosion is imposed. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to combine a dataset of SNe that are not strongly lensed and a dataset of strongly lensed SNe with measured time delays. We jointly constrain (i) \$H\_0\$ using the time delays as an absolute distance indicator, (ii) the lens model profiles using the magnification ratio of lensed and unlensed fluxes on the population level and (iii) the unlensed apparent magnitude distribution of the SNe population and the redshift-luminosity relation of the relative expansion history of the Universe. We apply our joint inference framework on a future expected data set of glSNe, and forecast that a sample of 144 glSNe of Type\textasciitilde Ia with well measured time series and imaging data will measure \$H\_0\$ to 1.5\textbackslash\%. We discuss strategies to mitigate systematics associated with using absolute flux measurements of glSNe to constrain the mass density profiles. Using the magnification of SNe images is a promising and complementary alternative to using stellar kinematics. Future surveys, such as the Rubin and \textbackslash textit\{Roman\} observatories, will be able to discover the necessary number of glSNe, and with additional follow-up observations this methodology will provide precise constraints on mass profiles and \$H\_0\$.},

The mass-sheet transform (MST) that leaves the lensing observables unchanged is considered the dominant source of residual uncertainty in \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$}. We quantify any potential effect of the MST with a flexible family of mass models, which directly encodes it, and they are hence maximally degenerate with \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$}. Our calculation is based on a new hierarchical Bayesian approach in which the MST is only constrained by stellar kinematics. The approach is validated on mock lenses, which are generated from hydrodynamic simulations. We first applied the inference to the TDCOSMO sample of seven lenses, six of which are from H0LiCOW, and measured km s\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$} Mpc\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. Secondly, in order to further constrain the deflector mass density profiles, we added imaging and spectroscopy for a set of 33 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample. For nine of the 33 SLAC lenses, we used resolved kinematics to constrain the stellar anisotropy. From the joint hierarchical analysis of the TDCOSMO+SLACS sample, we measured km s\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$} Mpc\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$}. This measurement assumes that the TDCOSMO and SLACS galaxies are drawn from the same parent population. The blind H0LiCOW, TDCOSMO-only and TDCOSMO+SLACS analyses are in mutual statistical agreement. The TDCOSMO+SLACS analysis prefers marginally shallower mass profiles than H0LiCOW or TDCOSMO-only. Without relying on the form of the mass density profile used by H0LiCOW, we achieve a ∼5\% measurement of \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$}. While our new hierarchical analysis does not statistically invalidate the mass profile assumptions by H0LiCOW – and thus the \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} measurement relying on them – it demonstrates the importance of understanding the mass density profile of elliptical galaxies. The uncertainties on \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} derived in this paper can be reduced by physical or observational priors on the form of the mass profile, or by additional data.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Observing strategies for this survey are being actively investigated, and the science capabilities can be best forecasted on the basis of simulated strategies from the LSST Operations Simulator (OpSim). OpSim simulates a stochastic realization of the sequence of LSST pointings over the survey duration, and is based on a model of the observatory (including telescope) and historical data of observational conditions. OpSim outputs contain a record of each simulated pointing of the survey along with a complete characterization of the pointing in terms of observing conditions, and some useful quantities derived from the characteristics of the pointing. Thus, each record can be efficiently used to derive the properties of observations of all astrophysical sources found in that pointing. However, in order to obtain the time series of observations (light curves) of a set of sources, it is often more convenient to compute all observations of an astrophysical source, and iterate over sources. In this document, we describe the open source python package OpSimSummary which allows for a convenient reordering. The objectives of this package are to provide users with an Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing all such observations and summarizing this information in the form intermediate data products usable by third party software such as SNANA, thereby also bridging the gap between official LSST products and pre-existing simulation codes.},

We analyse the baryon acoustic peak as a function of environment in the galaxy correlation function of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey CMASS sample. Dividing the sample into three sub-sets by smoothed local overdensity, we detect acoustic peaks in the six separate autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of the sub-samples. Fitting models to these correlation functions, calibrated by mock galaxy and dark matter catalogues, we find that the inferred distance scale is independent of environment, and consistent with the result of analysing the combined sample. The shape of the baryon acoustic feature, and the accuracy of density-field reconstruction in the Zeldovich approximation, varies with environment. By up-weighting underdense regions and down-weighting overdense regions in their contribution to the full-sample correlation function, by up to 50\{\{ per cent\}\}, we achieve a fractional improvement of a few per cent in the precision of baryon acoustic oscillation fits to the CMASS data and mock catalogues: the scatter in the preferred-scale fits to the ensemble of mocks improves from 1.45\{\{ per cent\}\} to 1.34\{\{ per cent\}\} (pre-reconstruction) and 1.03\{\{ per cent\}\} to 1.00\{\{ per cent\}\} (post-reconstruction).

Once calibrated for stellar population effects, SBF measurements with HST provide distances to early-type galaxies with unrivaled precision. Optical SBF data from HST for the Virgo and Fornax clusters give the relative distances of these nearby fiducial clusters with 2\% precision and constrain their internal structures. Observations in hand will allow us to tie the Coma cluster, the standard of comparison for distant cluster studies, into the same precise relative distance scale. The SBF method can be calibrated in an absolute sense either empirically from Cepheids or theoretically from stellar population models. The agreement between the model and empirical zero points has improved dramatically, providing an independent confirmation of the Cepheid distance scale. SBF is still brighter in the near-IR, and an ongoing program to calibrate the method for the F110W and F160W passbands of the Wide Field Camera~3 IR channel will enable accurate distance derivation whenever a large early-type galaxy or bulge is observed in these passbands at distances reaching well out into the Hubble flow.},

  abstract = {We report one of the most accurate measurements of the three-dimensional  large-scale galaxy power spectrum achieved to date, using 56159 redshifts of bright emission-line galaxies at effective redshift z \textasciitilde{} 0.6 from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We describe in detail how we construct the survey selection function allowing for the varying target completeness and redshift completeness. We measure the total power with an accuracy of approximately 5 per cent in wavenumber bands of Δk = 0.01h Mpc-1. A model power spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxy bias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a good fit to our data for scales k {$<$} 0.4h Mpc-1. The large-scale shape of the power spectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densities determined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. By splitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radial wavenumbers, we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. We use these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshift in the range 0.4 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.8, including a data point at z = 0.78 with an accuracy of 20 per cent. Our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistent prediction of the Λ cold dark matter model. The WiggleZ survey data will allow a wide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growth history, topology of cosmic structure and Gaussianity of the initial conditions. Our calculation of the survey selection function will be released at a future date via our website wigglez.swin.edu.au.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the baryon acoustic peak at redshifts z=  0.44, 0.6 and 0.73 in the galaxy correlation function of the final data set of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We combine our correlation function with lower redshift measurements from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, producing a stacked survey correlation function in which the statistical significance of the detection of the baryon acoustic peak is 4.9σ relative to a zero-baryon model with no peak. We fit cosmological models to this combined baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data set comprising six distance-redshift data points, and compare the results with similar cosmological fits to the latest compilation of supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The BAO and SNe data sets produce consistent measurements of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, when separately combined with the CMB, providing a powerful check for systematic errors in either of these distance probes. Combining all data sets we determine w=-1.03 ± 0.08 for a flat universe, consistent with a cosmological constant model. Assuming dark energy is a cosmological constant and varying the spatial curvature, we find Ωk=-0.004 ± 0.006.},

  abstract = {Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods  for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 106 spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg2, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49d in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55" during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92\% for all targets, and greater than 99\% for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90\% (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys.},

  abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog  (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z\textasciitilde 0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde 2\% to \textasciitilde 1\%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

  abstract = {We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z̃ 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z̃ 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in 2016 July.},

This activity is computationally expensive, since a typical project requires from 10'000 to 100'000 Boltzmann code executions. The newly released code CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) incorporates improved approximation schemes leading to a simultaneous gain in speed and precision. We describe here the three approximations used by CLASS for basic LambdaCDM models, namely: a baryon-photon tight-coupling approximation which can be set to first order, second order or to a compromise between the two; an ultra-relativistic fluid approximation which had not been implemented in public distributions before; and finally a radiation streaming approximation taking reionisation into account.},

  abstract = {At the epoch of decoupling, cosmic baryons had supersonic velocities relative to the dark matter that were coherent on large scales. These velocities subsequently slow the growth of small-scale structure and, via feedback processes, can influence the formation of larger galaxies. We examine the effect of streaming velocities on the galaxy correlation function, including all leading-order contributions for the first time. We find that the impact on the BAO peak is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of \textasciitilde 5) over the results of previous investigations, with the primary new effect due to advection: if a galaxy retains memory of the primordial streaming velocity, it does so at its Lagrangian, rather than Eulerian, position. Since correlations in the streaming velocity change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a significant shift in the observed BAO position. If streaming velocities impact tracer density at the 1\% level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO scale is shifted by approximately 0.5\%. This new effect, which is required to preserve Galilean invariance, greatly increases the importance of including streaming velocities in the analysis of upcoming BAO measurements and opens a new window to the astrophysics of galaxy formation.},

At 150 GHz, the camera consists of arrays of corrugated feedhorn-coupled TES polarimeters fabricated at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At 90 GHz, we use individually packaged dual-polarization absorber-coupled polarimeters developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Each 90 GHz pixel couples to the telescope through machined contoured feedhorns. The entire focal plane is read out using a digital frequency-domain multiplexer system. We discuss the design and goals of this experiment and provide a description of the detectors.},

  abstract = {We present a measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at redshift z = 2.35 from the three-dimensional correlation of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest absorption and quasars. The study uses 266 590 quasars in the redshift range 1.77 \&lt; z \&lt; 3.5 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14 (DR14). The sample includes the first two years of observations by the SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), providing new quasars and re-observations of BOSS quasars for improved statistical precision. Statistics are further improved by including Ly$\alpha$ absorption occurring in the Lyβ wavelength band of the spectra. From the measured BAO peak position along and across the line of sight, we determined the Hubble distance D\textsubscript{H} and the comoving angular diameter distance D\textsubscript{M} relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch r\textsubscript{d}: D\textsubscript{H}(z = 2.35)/r\textsubscript{d} = 9.20 ± 0.36 and D\textsubscript{M}(z = 2.35)/r\textsubscript{d} = 36.3 ± 1.8. These results are consistent at 1.5σ with the prediction of the best-fit spatially-flat cosmological model with the cosmological constant reported for the Planck (2016) analysis of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. Combined with the Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation measurement presented in a companion paper, the BAO measurements at z = 2.34 are within 1.7σ of the predictions of this model.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars has been used as a tracer of large-scale structure by means of the three-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function at redshift zsimeq 2.3, but the need to fit the quasar continuum in every absorption spectrum introduces a broadband distortion that is difficult to correct and causes a systematic error for measuring any broadband properties. We describe a k-space model for this broadband distortion based on a multiplicative correction to the power spectrum of the transmitted flux fraction that suppresses power on scales corresponding to the typical length of a Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectrum. Implementing the distortion model in fits for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak position in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation, we find that the fitting method recovers the input values of the linear bias parameter b\textsubscript{F} and the redshift-space distortion parameter β\textsubscript{F} for mock data sets with a systematic error of less than 0.5\%. Applied to the auto-correlation measured for BOSS Data Release 11, our method improves on the previous treatment of broadband distortions in BAO fitting by providing a better fit to the data using fewer parameters and reducing the statistical errors on β\textsubscript{F} and the combination b\textsubscript{F}(1+β\textsubscript{F}) by more than a factor of seven.

The study exploits a large sample of new quasars from the first two years of observations by the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). The CIV forest is a weaker tracer of large-scale structure than the Ly$\alpha$ forest, but benefits from being accessible at redshifts z\&lt;2 where the quasar number density from eBOSS is high. Our data sample consists of 287,651 CIV forest quasars in the redshift range 1.4\&lt;z\&lt;3.5 and 387,315 tracer quasars with 1.2\&lt;z\&lt;3.5. We measure large-scale correlations from CIV absorption occuring in three distinct quasar rest-frame wavelength bands of the spectra referred to as the CIV forest, the SiIV forest and the Ly$\alpha$ forest. From the combined fit to the quasar-CIV cross-correlations for the CIV forest and the SiIV forest, the CIV redshift-space distortion parameter is β\textsubscript{CIV}=0.27\textsubscript{ -0.14 -0.26}\textsuperscript{ +0.16 +0.34} and its combination with the CIV linear transmission bias parameter is b\textsubscript{CIV}(1+β\textsubscript{CIV})=-0.0183\textsubscript{ -0.0014 -0.0029}\textsuperscript{ +0.0013 +0.0025} (1σ and 2σ statistical errors) at the mean redshift z=2.00. Splitting the sample at z=2.2 to constrain the bias evolution with redshift yields the power-law exponent γ=0.60±0.63, indicating a significantly weaker redshift-evolution than for the Ly$\alpha$ forest linear transmission bias. Additionally, we demonstrate that CIV absorption has the potential to be used as a probe of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). While the current data set is insufficient for a detection of the BAO peak feature, the final quasar samples for redshifts 1.4\&lt;z\&lt;2.2 from eBOSS and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are expected to provide measurements of the isotropic BAO scale to \textasciitilde 7\% and \textasciitilde 3\% precision, respectively, at zsimeq1.6. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {The upcoming generation of galaxy surveys will probe the distribution of matter in the Universe with unprecedented accuracy. Measurements of the matter power spectrum at different scales and red shifts will provide stringent constraints on the cosmological parameters. However, on non-linear scales this will require an accurate evaluation of the covariance matrix. Here, we compute the covariance matrix of the three-dimensional matter density power spectrum for the concordance ΛCDM cosmology from an ensemble of N-body simulations of the Dark Energy Universe Simulation - Parallel Universe Runs (DEUS-PUR). This consists of 12 288 realizations of a (656 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc)\textsuperscript{3} simulation box with 256\textsuperscript{3} particles. We combine this set with an auxiliary sample of 96 simulations of the same volume with 1024\textsuperscript{3} particles. We find the N-body mass resolution effect to be an important source of systematic errors on the covariance at high redshift and small intermediate scales. We correct for this effect by introducing an empirical statistical method which provide an accurate determination of the covariance matrix over a wide range of scales including the baryon oscillations interval. Contrary to previous studies that used smaller N-body ensembles, we find the power spectrum distribution to significantly deviate from expectations of a Gaussian random density field at k ≳ 0.25 h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} and z \&lt; 0.5. This suggests that for the finite-volume surveys, an unbiased estimate of the ensemble-averaged band power at these scales and red shifts may require a more careful assessment of non-Gaussian errors than previously considered.},

We believe there is a strong need for such now, when cosmology is swiftly becoming a strict and vast science, and the book would be extremely useful for the youth pouring in this area of research. Indeed, the only way to rise over the popular level in any science is to master its alphabet, that is, to learn to solve problems. Of course, most of modern textbooks on cosmology include problems. However, a reader, exhausted by high theory, may often be thwarted by the lack of time and strength to solve them. Might it be worth sometimes to change the tactics and just throw those who wish to learn to swim into the water? The proposed problems constitute our contribution to this cause. There are over 1000 problems, divided into 14 chapters, covering topics from the dynamics of the expanding Universe and CMB to cosmology beyond the Lambda-CDM model and holography. We intend to publish their solutions in later editions. The reader, however, is encouraged to look for answers independently, even though - or especially so because - the problems range from easy to not quite and from elements of scientific folklore already to those with answers not quite settled.},

This calibration is then applied to the measurement of the lower cut-off of the N\textsubscript{H I}-N\textsubscript{H I} distribution recently presented by Rudie et al. We infer a power-law T-∆ relation, T = T\textsubscript{0}∆\textsuperscript{γ - 1}, with a temperature at mean density, T\textsubscript{0} = [1.00\^\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.21\}]× 10\textsuperscript{4} K and slope (γ - 1) = 0.54 ± 0.11. The slope is fully consistent with that advocated by the analysis of Rudie et al.; however, the temperature at mean density is lower by almost a factor of 2, primarily due to an adjustment in the relationship between column density and physical density assumed by these authors. These new results are in excellent agreement with the recent temperature measurements of Becker et al., based on the curvature of the transmitted flux in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. This suggests that the thermal state of the IGM at this redshift is reasonably well characterized over the range of densities probed by these methods.},

We give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe the changes to the pipeline that have been implemented for BOSS relative to previous SDSS-I/II versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasar redshift templates. For the color-selected "CMASS" sample of massive galaxies at redshift 0.4 {$<\sptilde$} z {$<\sptilde$} 0.8 targeted by BOSS for the purposes of large-scale cosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classification success rate of 98.7\% and confirms 95.4\% of unique CMASS targets as galaxies (with the balance being mostly M stars). Based on visual inspections of a subset of BOSS galaxies, we find that approximately 0.2\% of confidently reported CMASS sample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and about 0.4\% of all CMASS spectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentially recoverable. The BOSS pipeline confirms that \textasciitilde 51.5\% of the quasar targets have quasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars and low signal-to-noise spectra. Statistical (as opposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise are typically a few tens of km s-1 for both galaxies and quasars, with a significant tail to a few hundreds of km s-1 for quasars. We test the accuracy of these statistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding them underestimated by a factor of 1.19-1.34 for galaxies and by a factor of two for quasars. We assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and other factors on galaxy redshift success. Finally, we document known issues with the BOSS DR9 spectroscopic data set and describe directions of ongoing development.},

The algorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2D point-spread functions (PSFs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which is only correct for a limited class of separable PSFs. The algorithm results in statistically independent extracted samples in the 1D spectrum, and preserves the full native resolution of the 2D spectrograph without degradation. Both the statistical errors and the 1D resolution of the extracted spectrum are accurately determined, allowing a correct χ2 comparison of any model spectrum with the data. Using a model PSF similar to that found in the red channel of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrograph, we compare the performance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction, and also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foreground estimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. This work demonstrates the feasibility of current and next-generation multifiber spectrographs for faint-galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-sky foregrounds. We describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fiber cross talk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to the analysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could be generalized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination of astronomical imaging data.},

  abstract = {We construct a pipeline for simulating weak lensing cosmology surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), taking as inputs telescope sensitivity curves; correlated source flux, size and redshift distributions; a simple ionospheric model; source redshift and ellipticity measurement errors. We then use this simulation pipeline to optimize a 2-yr weak lensing survey performed with the first deployment of the SKA (SKA1). Our assessments are based on the total signal to noise of the recovered shear power spectra, a metric that we find to correlate very well with a standard dark energy figure of merit. We first consider the choice of frequency band, trading off increases in number counts at lower frequencies against poorer resolution; our analysis strongly prefers the higher frequency Band 2 (950-1760 MHz) channel of the SKA-MID telescope to the lower frequency Band 1 (350-1050 MHz). Best results would be obtained by allowing the centre of Band 2 to shift towards lower frequency, around 1.1 GHz. We then move on to consider survey size, finding that an area of 5000 deg2 is optimal for most SKA1 instrumental configurations. Finally, we forecast the performance of a weak lensing survey with the second deployment of the SKA. The increased survey size (3π steradian) and sensitivity improves both the signal to noise and the dark energy metrics by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Upcoming astronomical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey  Telescope (LSST) will rely on photometric classification to identify the majority of the transients and variables that they discover. We present a set of techniques for photometric classification that can be applied even when the training set of spectroscopically confirmed objects is heavily biased toward bright, low-redshift objects. Using Gaussian process regression to model arbitrary light curves in all bands simultaneously, we “augment” the training set by generating new versions of the original light curves covering a range of redshifts and observing conditions. We train a boosted decision tree classifier on features extracted from the augmented light curves, and we show how such a classifier can be designed to produce classifications that are independent of the redshift distributions of objects in the training sample. Our classification algorithm was the best-performing among the 1094 models considered in the blinded phase of the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, scoring 0.468 on the organizers’ logarithmic-loss metric with flat weights for all object classes in the training set, and achieving an AUC of 0.957 for classification of SNe Ia. Our results suggest that spectroscopic campaigns used for training photometric classifiers should focus on typing large numbers of well-observed, intermediate-redshift transients, instead of attempting to type a sample of transients that is directly representative of the full data set being classified. All of the algorithms described in this paper are implemented in the avocado software package (https://www.github.com/kboone/avocado).},

The simulations are designed to match the requirements imposed by the quality of BOSS and eBOSS data. They are made using either 2x768\$\^3\$ or 2x192\$\^3\$ particles, spanning volumes ranging from (25 Mpc.h\$\^\{-1\})\^3\$ for high-resolution simulations to (100 Mpc.h\$\^\{-1\})\^3\$ for large-volume ones. Using a splicing technique, the resolution is further enhanced to reach the equivalent of simulations with 2x3072\$\^3\$= 58 billion particles in a (100 Mpc.h\$\^\{-1\}\$)\^3 box size, i.e. a mean mass per gas particle of 1.2x10\$\^5\$M\_sun.h\$\^\{-1\}\$. We show that the resulting power spectrum is accurate at the 2\% level over the full range from a few Mpc to several tens of Mpc. We explore the effect on the one-dimensional transmitted-flux power spectrum of 4 cosmological parameters (\$n\_s, \textbackslash sigma\_8, \textbackslash Omega\_m, H\_0\$) and 2 astrophysical parameters (\$T\_0, \textbackslash gamma\$) related to the heating rate of the IGM. By varying the input parameters around a central model chosen to be in agreement with the latest Planck results, we built a grid of simulations that allows the study of the impact on the flux power spectrum of these six relevant parameters. We improve upon previous studies by not only measuring the effect of each parameter individually, but also probing the impact of the simultaneous variation of each pair of parameters. We thus provide a full second-order expansion, including cross-terms, around our central model. We check the validity of the second-order expansion with independent simulations obtained either with different cosmological parameters or different seeds. Finally, a comparison to the one-dimensional Ly-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest power spectrum obtained with BOSS shows an excellent agreement.},

In this work, we have compiled a new sample of 465 peculiar velocities from low redshift ( \$z\$ {$<$} 0.067) Type Ia supernovae. We compare the reconstructed velocity field derived from the 2M++ galaxy redshift compilation to the supernovae, the SFI++ and the 2MTF Tully-Fisher distance catalogues. We used a forward method to jointly infer the distances and the velocities of distance indicators by comparing the observations to the reconstruction. Comparison of the reconstructed peculiar velocity fields to observations allows us to infer the cosmological parameter combination fσ8, and the bulk flow velocity arising from outside the survey volume. The residual bulk flow arising from outside the 2M++ volume is inferred to be \$171\^\{+11\}\_\{-11\}\$ km s-1 in the direction l = 301° ± 4° and b = 0° ± 3°. We obtain fσ8 = 0.400 ± 0.017, equivalent to S8 ≍ σ8(Ωm/0.3)0.55 = 0.776 ± 0.033, which corresponds to an approximately \$4\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\textbackslash,\$ statistical uncertainty on the value of fσ8.

Our method consistently accounts for the inhomogeneous Malmquist bias using analytic integration along the line-of-sight. By testing our method on a simulation, we show that our method gives an unbiased reconstruction of the velocity field. We show that not accounting for the inhomogeneous Malmquist bias can lead to significant biases in the forward-modelled reconstructions. We applied our method to a peculiar velocity data set consisting of the SFI++ and 2MTF Tully-Fisher catalogues and the A2 supernovae compilation, thus obtaining a novel velocity reconstruction in the local Universe. Our velocity reconstructions have a cosmological power spectrum consistent with the theoretical expectation. Furthermore, we obtain a full description of the uncertainties on reconstruction through samples of the posterior distribution. We validate our velocity reconstruction of the local Universe by comparing it to an independent reconstruction using the 2M++ galaxy catalogue, obtaining good agreement between the two reconstructions. Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that our velocity model performs better than the adaptive kernel smoothed velocity with the same peculiar velocity data. However, our velocity model does not perform as well as the velocity reconstruction from the 2M++ galaxy catalogue, due to the sparse and noisy nature of the peculiar velocity tracer samples. The method presented here provides a way to include peculiar velocity data in initial condition reconstruction frameworks.},

Utilising non-linear information coming from small physical scales can greatly enhance these constraints. At the heart of these analyses is the matter power spectrum. Here we employ a simple method, dubbed "Hybrid Pl(k)", based on the Gaussian Streaming Model (GSM), to calculate the quasi non-linear redshift space matter power spectrum multipoles. This employs a fully non-linear and theoretically general prescription for the matter power spectrum. We test this approach against comoving Lagrangian acceleration simulation measurements performed in GR, DGP and f(R) gravity and find that our method performs comparably or better to the dark matter TNS redshift space power spectrum model \{for dark matter. When comparing the redshift space multipoles for halos, we find that the Gaussian approximation of the GSM with a linear bias and a free stochastic term, N, is competitive to the TNS model.\} Our approach offers many avenues for improvement in accuracy as well as further unification under the halo model.},

  abstract = {We derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energy models from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and a recent reanalysis of Type Ia supernova (SN) data. In particular, we take advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (LyaF) in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Treating the BAO scale as an uncalibrated standard ruler, BAO data alone yield a high confidence detection of dark energy; in combination with the CMB angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Adding the CMB-calibrated physical scale of the sound horizon, the combination of BAO and SN data into an “inverse distance ladder” yields a measurement of H0=67.3±1.1 km s−1 Mpc−1, with 1.7\% precision. This measurement assumes standard prerecombination physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature, so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat ΛCDM cosmology is an important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For constant dark energy (Λ), our BAO+SN+CMB combination yields matter density Ωm=0.301±0.008 and curvature Ωk=−0.003±0.003. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints are always consistent with flat ΛCDM values at ≈1σ. While the overall χ2 of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO measurements are in moderate (2–2.5σ) tension with model predictions. Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high redshift remain consistent with our expansion history constraints, and they yield a higher H0 and lower matter clustering amplitude, improving agreement with some low redshift observations. Expansion history alone yields an upper limit on the summed mass of neutrino species, ∑mν{$<$}0.56 eV (95\% confidence), improving to ∑mν{$<$}0.25 eV if we include the lensing signal in the Planck CMB power spectrum. In a flat ΛCDM model that allows extra relativistic species, our data combination yields Neff=3.43±0.26; while the LyaF BAO data prefer higher Neff when excluding galaxy BAO, the galaxy BAO alone favor Neff≈3. When structure growth is extrapolated forward from the CMB to low redshift, standard dark energy models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.},

  abstract = {Thomson optical depth tau measurements from Planck provide new insights into the reionization of the universe. In pursuit of model-independent constraints on the properties of the ionising sources, we determine the empirical evolution of the cosmic ionizing emissivity. We use a simple two-parameter model to map out the evolution in the emissivity at z{$>\sptilde$}6 from the new Planck optical depth tau measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectra and from the prevalence of Ly-alpha emission in z\textasciitilde 7-8 galaxies. We find the redshift evolution in the emissivity dot\{N\}\_\{ion\}(z) required by the observations to be d(log Nion)/dz=-0.15(-0.11)(+0.08), largely independent of the assumed clumping factor C\_\{HII\} and entirely independent of the nature of the ionising sources. The trend in dot\{N\}\_\{ion\}(z) is well-matched by the evolution of the galaxy UV-luminosity density (dlog\_\{10\} rho\_UV/dz=-0.11+/-0.04) to a magnitude limit {$>\sptilde$}-13 mag, suggesting that galaxies are the sources that drive the reionization of the universe. The role of galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the UV luminosity density rho\_UV to dot(N)\_\{ion\}(z) being possible for physically-plausible values of the escape fraction f\_\{esc\}, the Lyman-continuum photon production efficiency xi\_\{ion\}, and faint-end cut-off \$M\_\{lim\}\$ to the luminosity function. Quasars/AGN appear to match neither the redshift evolution nor normalization of the ionizing emissivity. Based on the inferred evolution in the ionizing emissivity, we estimate that the z\textasciitilde 10 UV-luminosity density is 8(-4)(+15)x lower than at \$z\textasciitilde 6, consistent with the observations. The present approach of contrasting the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity with that of the galaxy UV luminosity density adds to the growing observational evidence that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of the universe.},

  abstract = {We describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating  the redshift of quasars. It can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshift ranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, and naturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelength photometry. We build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying the extreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. By integrating this density over redshift, one can obtain quasar flux densities in different redshift ranges. This approach allows for efficient, consistent, and fast classification and photometric redshift estimation. This is achieved by combining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basis of our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through the use of many simple components with many parameters. We show that this technique is competitive with the best photometric quasar classification techniques—which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and high signal-to-noise ratio data—and with the best photometric redshift techniques when applied to broadband optical data. We demonstrate that the inclusion of UV and NIR data significantly improves photometric quasar-star separation and essentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent to the ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noise ratio. For quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the SDSS 84\% and 97\% of the objects with Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV and UKIDSS NIR data have photometric redshifts within 0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to about a factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. Our code to calculate quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions is publicly available.},

  abstract = {We present the SDSS-XDQSO quasar targeting catalog for efficient  flux-based quasar target selection down to the faint limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalog, even at medium redshifts (2.5 {$<\sptilde$} z {$<\sptilde$} 3) where the stellar contamination is significant. We build models of the distributions of stars and quasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying the extreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. We convolve this density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability that an object is a quasar. This approach results in a targeting algorithm that is more principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. We apply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z {$<$} 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 3.5), and high-redshift (z{$>$}3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060 point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag in the 14,555 deg2 of imaging from SDSS Data Release 8. The catalog can be used to define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasar survey, such as that needed for the SDSS-III's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey project. We show that the XDQSO technique performs as well as the current best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, and outperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshift quasars of our primary interest. We make code to reproduce the XDQSO quasar target selection publicly available.},

  abstract = {We compare and validate COLA (COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration) simulations against existing emulators in the literature, namely Bacco and Euclid Emulator 2. Our analysis focuses on the non-linear response function, i.e., the ratio between the non-linear dark matter power spectrum in a given cosmology with respect to a pre-defined reference cosmology, which is chosen to be the Euclid Emulator 2 reference cosmology in this paper. We vary three cosmological parameters, the total matter density, the amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbations and the spectral index. By comparing the COLA non-linear response function with those computed from each emulator in the redshift range \$0 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 3\$, we find that the COLA method is in excellent agreement with the two emulators for scales up to \$k \textbackslash sim 1 \textbackslash{} h\$/Mpc as long as the deviations of the matter power spectrum from the reference cosmology are not too large. We validate the implementation of massive neutrinos in our COLA simulations by varying the sum of neutrino masses to three different values, \$0.0\$ eV, \$0.058\$ eV and \$0.15\$ eV. We show that all three non-linear prescriptions used in this work agree at the \$1\textbackslash\%\$ level at \$k \textbackslash leq 1 \textbackslash{} h\$/Mpc. We then introduce the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy in our COLA simulations using the \$N\$-body gauge method. We consider two different modified gravity models in which the growth of structure is enhanced or suppressed at small scales, and show that the response function with respect to the change of modified gravity parameters depends weakly on cosmological parameters in these models.},

Building a simple analytical modeling, based on a truncated Zeldovich approximation, we estimate the intergalactic medium power spectrum and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux decrement power spectrum along the line of sight. We recover the results of numerical simulations for f(R)-gravity models and present new results for K-mouflage scenarios. We find that the shape of the distortion due to the modified gravity depends on the model, through the scale-dependence or not of their growth rate. This is more clearly seen in the three-dimensional power spectrum than in the one-dimensional power spectrum, where the line-of-sight integration smoothes the deviation. Whilst the Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectrum does not provide competitive bounds for f(R) theories, it could provide useful constraints for the K-mouflage models. Thus, the efficiency of the Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectrum as a probe of modified-gravity scenarios depends on the type of screening mechanism and the related scale dependence it induces. The prospect of a full recovery of the three-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectrum from data would also lead to stronger constraints and a better understanding of screening mechanisms. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Galaxy clustering is a standard cosmological probe that is commonly analysed through two-point statistics. In observations, the estimation of the two-point correlation function crucially relies on counting pairs in a random catalogue. The latter contains a large number of randomly distributed points, which accounts for the survey window function. Random pair counts can also be advantageously used for modelling the window function in the observed power spectrum. Since pair counting scales as \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\^2)\$, where \$N\$ is the number of points, the computational time to measure random pair counts can be very expensive for large surveys. In this work, we present an alternative approach for estimating those counts that does not rely on the use of a random catalogue. We derived an analytical expression for the anisotropic random-random pair counts that accounts for the galaxy radial distance distribution, survey geometry, and possible galaxy weights. Considering the cases of the VIPERS and SDSS-BOSS redshift surveys, we find that the analytical calculation is in excellent agreement with the pair counts obtained from random catalogues. The main advantage of this approach is that the primary calculation only takes a few minutes on a single CPU and it does not depend on the number of random points. Furthermore, it allows for an accuracy on the monopole equivalent to what we would otherwise obtain when using a random catalogue with about 1500 times more points than in the data at hand. We also describe and test an approximate expression for data-random pair counts that is less accurate than for random-random counts, but still provides subpercent accuracy on the monopole. The presented formalism should be very useful in accounting for the window function in next-generation surveys, which will necessitate accurate two-point window function estimates over huge observed cosmological volumes.},

  abstract = {Recent cosmological analyses (e.g., JLA, Pantheon) of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) have propagated systematic uncertainties into a covariance matrix and either binned or smoothed the systematic vectors in redshift space. We demonstrate that systematic error budgets of these analyses can be improved by a factor of \$\textbackslash sim1.5\textbackslash times\$ with the use of unbinned and unsmoothed covariance matrices. To understand this, we employ a separate approach that simultaneously fits for cosmological parameters and additional self-calibrating scale parameters that constrain the size of each systematic. We show that the covariance-matrix approach and scale-parameter approach yield equivalent results, implying that in both cases the data can self-calibrate certain systematic uncertainties, but that this ability is hindered when information is binned or smoothed in redshift space. We review the top systematic uncertainties in current analyses and find that the reduction of systematic uncertainties in the unbinned case depends on whether a systematic is consistent with varying the cosmological model and whether or not the systematic can be described by additional correlations between SN properties and luminosity. Furthermore, we show that the power of self-calibration increases with the size of the dataset, which presents a tremendous opportunity for upcoming analyses of photometrically classified samples, like those of Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (NGRST). However, to take advantage of self-calibration in large, photometrically-classified samples, we must first address the issue that binning is required in currently-used photometric methodologies.},

We combine the DES-SN sample with an external sample of 122 low-redshift (z {$<$} 0.1) SNe Ia, resulting in a “DES-SN3YR” sample of 329 SNe Ia. Our cosmological analyses are blinded: after combining our DES-SN3YR distances with constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background, our uncertainties in the measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w, are 0.042 (stat) and 0.059 (stat+syst) at 68\% confidence. We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly equal contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias corrections, and instrumental bias corrections. We also include several new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample is less than one-third the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on w are only larger by 1.4×, showing the impact of the DES-SN Ia light-curve quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization parameters of the DES-SNe Ia are in agreement with earlier SN Ia samples such as Pan-STARRS1 and the Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find smaller intrinsic scatter about the Hubble diagram (0.077 mag). Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble residual step (0.007 ± 0.018 mag) as a function of host-galaxy mass for the DES subset, in 2.4σ tension with previous measurements. We also present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe Ia inserted in DECam images and using large catalog-level simulations to test for biases in our analysis pipelines.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters from the Pantheon+ analysis of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ranging in redshift from \$z=0.001\$ to 2.26. This work features an increased sample size, increased redshift span, and improved treatment of systematic uncertainties in comparison to the original Pantheon analysis and results in a factor of two improvement in cosmological constraining power. For a Flat\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, we find \$\textbackslash Omega\_M=0.338\textbackslash pm0.018\$ from SNe Ia alone. For a Flat\$w\_0\$CDM model, we measure \$w\_0=-0.89\textbackslash pm0.13\$ from SNe Ia alone, H\$\_0=72.86\^\{+0.94\}\_\{-1.06\}\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ when including the Cepheid host distances and covariance (SH0ES), and \$w\_0=-0.978\^\{+0.024\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ when combining the SN likelihood with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO); both \$w\_0\$ values are consistent with a cosmological constant. We also present the most precise measurements to date on the evolution of dark energy in a Flat\$w\_0w\_a\$CDM universe, and measure \$w\_a=-0.4\^\{+1.0\}\_\{-1.8\}\$ from Pantheon+ alone, H\$\_0=73.40\^\{+0.99\}\_\{-1.22\}\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ when including SH0ES, and \$w\_a=-0.65\^\{+0.28\}\_\{-0.32\}\$ when combining Pantheon+ with CMB and BAO data. Finally, we find that systematic uncertainties in the use of SNe Ia along the distance ladder comprise less than one third of the total uncertainty in the measurement of H\$\_0\$ and cannot explain the present "Hubble tension" between local measurements and early-Universe predictions from the cosmological model.},

  abstract = {Cosmologists are facing the problem of the analysis of a huge quantity of data when observing the sky. The methods used in cosmology are, for the most of them, relying on astrophysical models, and thus, for the classification, they usually use a machine learning approach in two-steps, which consists in, first, extracting features, and second, using a classifier. In this paper, we are specifically studying the supernovae phenomenon and especially the binary classification "I.a supernovae versus not-I.a supernovae". We present two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) defeating the current state-of-the-art. The first one is adapted to time series and thus to the treatment of supernovae light-curves. The second one is based on a Siamese CNN and is suited to the nature of data, i.e. their sparsity and their weak quantity (small learning database).},

A number of potential contaminants and systematic effects are also studied in detail. The overall picture is encouraging—if autocorrelation calibration can be controlled to a sufficient level, Phase I of the Square Kilometre Array should be able to constrain the dark energy equation of state about as well as a DETF Stage IV galaxy redshift survey like Euclid, in roughly the same time frame.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing an estimate of linear baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)  from an evolved galaxy field has become a standard technique in recent analyses. By partially removing non-linear damping caused by bulk motions, the real-space BAO peak in the correlation function is sharpened, and oscillations in the power spectrum are visible to smaller scales. In turn these lead to stronger measurements of the BAO scale. Future surveys are being designed assuming that this improvement has been applied, and this technique is therefore of critical importance for future BAO measurements. A number of reconstruction techniques are available, but the most widely used is a simple algorithm that decorrelates large-scale and small-scale modes approximately removing the bulk-flow displacements by moving the overdensity field. We consider the practical implementation of this algorithm, looking at the efficiency of reconstruction as a function of the assumptions made for the bulk-flow scale, the shot-noise level in a random catalogue used to quantify the mask and the method used to estimate the bulk-flow shifts. We also examine the efficiency of reconstruction against external factors including galaxy density, volume and edge effects, and consider their impact for future surveys. Throughout we make use of the mocks catalogues created for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Date Release 11 samples covering 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7 (CMASS) and 0.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.43 (LOWZ), to empirically test these changes.},

The method has been designed for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) galaxy survey but may have applications beyond this. We propose a modification to the usual correlation function that nulls the almost purely angular modes affected by survey incompleteness due to fiber assignment. Predictions of this modified statistic can be calculated given a model of the two point correlation function. The new statistic can be computed with a slight modification to the data catalogues input to the standard correlation function code and does not incur any additional computational time. Finally we show that the spherically averaged baryon acoustic oscillation signal is not biased by the new statistic.},

  abstract = {We present a fast iterative fast Fourier transform (FFT) based reconstruction algorithm that allows for non-parallel redshift-space distortions (RSDs). We test our algorithm on both N-body dark matter simulations and mock distributions of galaxies designed to replicate galaxy survey conditions. We compare solenoidal and irrotational components of the redshift distortion and show that an approximation of this distortion leads to a better estimate of the real-space potential (and therefore faster convergence) than ignoring the RSD when estimating the displacement field. Our iterative reconstruction scheme converges in two iterations for the mock samples corresponding to Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey CMASS Data Release 11 when we start with an approximation of the RSD. The scheme takes six iterations when the initial estimate, measured from the redshift-space overdensity, has no RSD correction. Slower convergence would be expected for surveys covering a larger angle on the sky. We show that this FFT based method provides a better estimate of the real-space displacement field than a configuration space method that uses finite difference routines to compute the potential for the same grid resolution. Finally, we show that a lognormal transform of the overdensity, used as a proxy for the linear overdensity, is beneficial in estimating the full displacement field from a dense sample of tracers. However, the lognormal transform of the overdensity does not perform well when estimating the displacements from sparser simulations with a more realistic galaxy density.},

It is shown using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that the original four groups in the Branch diagram are well-defined and robust in this parameterization. We find three continuous groups that describe the behavior of our sample in [\$M\_B\$, \textbackslash vsi] space. Extending the GMM into the full 4-D space yields a grouping system that only slightly alters group definitions in the [\$M\_B\$, \textbackslash vsi] projection, showing that most of the clustering information in [\$M\_B\$, \textbackslash vsi] is already contained in the 2-D GMM groupings. However, the full 4-D space does divide group membership for faster objects between core-normal and broad-line objects in the Branch diagram. A significant correlation between \$M\_B\$ and pEW(\textbackslash ion\{Si\}\{2\}\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash lambda5972\$) is found, which implies that Branch group membership can be well-constrained by spectroscopic quantities alone. In general, we find that higher-dimensional GMMs reduce the uncertainty of group membership for objects between the originally defined Branch groups. We also find that the broad-line Branch group becomes nearly distinct with the inclusion of \textbackslash vsi, indicating that this subclass of SNe Ia may be somehow different from the other groups.},

  abstract = {We report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-redshift quasars. The study uses 48 640 quasars in the redshift range 2.1 ≤ z ≤ 3.5 from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). At a mean redshift z = 2.3, we measure the monopole and quadrupole components of the correlation function for separations in the range 20 h-1 Mpc {$<$} r {$<$} 200 h-1 Mpc. A peak in the correlation function is seen at a separation equal to (1.01 ± 0.03) times the distance expected for the BAO peak within a concordance ΛCDM cosmology. This first detection of the BAO peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated, results in constraints on the angular diameter distance DA and the expansion rate H at z = 2.3 that, combined with priors on H0 and the baryon density, require the existence of dark energy. Combined with constraints derived from cosmic microwave background observations, this result implies H(z = 2.3) = (224 ± 8) km s-1 Mpc-1, indicating that the time derivative of the cosmological scale parameter ȧ = H(z = 2.3)/(1 + z) is significantly greater than that measured with BAO at z \textasciitilde{} 0.5. This demonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range 0.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.3, as expected from the matter domination during this epoch. Combined with measurements of H0, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed by acceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

We also extend QuasarNET to classify spectra with broad absorption line (BAL) features, achieving an accuracy of \$98.0\textbackslash pm0.4\$\textbackslash\% for recognizing BAL and \$97.0\textbackslash pm0.2\$\textbackslash\% for rejecting non-BAL quasars. QuasarNET is trained on data of low signal-to-noise and medium resolution, typical of current and future astrophysical surveys, and could be easily applied to classify spectra from current and upcoming surveys such as eBOSS, DESI and 4MOST.},

  abstract = {Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ (Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$) spectra provide insights into the small-scale structure and kinematics of neutral hydrogen (HI) within galaxies as well as the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The former defines the intrinsic spectrum of a galaxy, which is modified by the latter. These two effects are degenerate. Using the IllustrisTNG100 simulation, we study the impact of the IGM on Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ spectral shapes between \$z\textbackslash sim 0\$ and \$5\$. We compute the distribution of the expected Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ peaks and of the peak asymmetry for different intrinsic spectra, redshifts and large-scale environments. We find that the commonly used averaged transmission curves give an incorrect perception of the observed spectral properties. We show that the distributions of peak counts and asymmetry can lift the degeneracy between the intrinsic spectrum and the IGM absorption. For example, we expect a significant number of triple peaked Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ spectra (up to 30\% at \$z\textbackslash sim 3\$) if the galaxies' HI distribution become more porous at higher redshift as predicted by cosmological simulations. We provide a public catalog of transmission curves to be used in future simulations and observations to allow a more realistic IGM treatment.},

Here we focus on modelling redshift-space distortions in ξ(π, σ), the two-point correlation function in separate line of sight and perpendicular directions, on large scales. We use large mock simulations to study the validity of models and errors. We show that errors in the data are dominated by a shot-noise term that is 40 per cent larger than the Poisson error commonly used. We first use the normalized quadrupole for the whole sample (mean z = 0.34) to estimate β = f(Ω\textsubscript{m})/b = 0.34 +/- 0.03, where f(Ω\textsubscript{m}) is the linear velocity growth factor and b is the linear bias parameter that relates galaxy to matter fluctuations on large scales. We next use the full ξ(π, σ) plane to find Ω\textsubscript{0m} = 0.245 +/- 0.020 (h = 0.72) and the biased amplitude b σ\textsubscript{8} = 1.56 +/- 0.09. For standard gravity, we can combine these measurements to break degeneracies and find σ\textsubscript{8} = 0.85 +/- 0.06, b = 1.85 +/- 0.25 and f(Ω\textsubscript{m}) = 0.64 +/- 0.09. We present constraints for modified theories of gravity and find that standard gravity is consistent with data as long as 0.80 \&lt; σ\textsubscript{8} \&lt; 0.92. We also calculate the cross-correlation with WMAP5 and show how both methods to measure the growth history are complementary to constrain non-standard models of gravity. Finally, we show results for different redshift slices, including a prominent BAO peak in the monopole at different redshifts. The ξ(π, σ) data on large scales is shown to be in remarkable agreement with predictions and shows a characteristic large region of negative correlation in the line of sight, a BAO ring and a prominent radial BAO peak. The significance of this is presented in Paper IV of this series. We include a study of possible systematic effects in our analysis to find that these results are quite robust.},

  abstract = {Modern cosmology predicts that a galaxy overdensity (e.g., protocluster) will be associated with a large intergalactic medium gas reservoir, which can be traced by Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption. We have undertaken a systematic study of the relation between Coherently Strong intergalactic Ly$\alpha$ Absorption systems (CoSLAs), which have the highest optical depth (τ) in the τ distribution, and mass overdensities on the scales of ˜10-20 h -1 comoving Mpc. On such large scales, our cosmological simulations show a strong correlation between the effective optical depth (τ eff) of the CoSLAs and the three-dimensional mass overdensity. In spectra with moderate signal-to-noise ratio, however, the profiles of CoSLAs can be confused with individual high column density absorbers. For z {$>$} 2.6, where the corresponding Lyβ is redshifted to the optical, we have developed a selection technique to distinguish between these two alternatives. We have applied this technique to ˜6000 sight lines provided by Sloan Digital Sky Survey III quasar survey at z = 2.6-3.3 with a continuum-to-noise ratio greater than 8, and we present a sample of five CoSLA candidates with τ eff on 15 h -1 Mpc greater than 4.5× the mean optical depth. At lower redshifts of z {$<$} 2.6, where the background quasar density is higher, the overdensity can be traced by intergalactic absorption groups using multiple sight lines with small angular separations. Our overdensity searches fully use the current and next generation of Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys, which cover a survey volume of {$>$}1 (h -1 Gpc)3. Systems traced by CoSLAs will yield a uniform sample of the most massive overdensities at z {$>$} 2 to provide stringent constraints to models of structure formation.},

  abstract = {We present a measurement of the Lyman $\alpha$ flux probability distribution function (PDF) obtained from a set of eight high-resolution quasar spectra with emission redshifts in the range 3.3 ≤z≤ 3.8. We carefully study the effect of metal absorption lines on the shape of the PDF. Metals have a larger impact on the PDF measurements at lower redshift, where there are relatively fewer Lyman $\alpha$ absorption lines. This may be explained by an increase in the number of metal lines that are blended with Lyman $\alpha$ absorption lines towards higher redshift, but may also be due to the presence of fewer metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at earlier times. We also provide a new measurement of the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth, τ\textsubscript{eff}, at 2.8 ≤z≤ 3.6, and find no evidence for a deviation from a power-law evolution in the log (τ\textsubscript{eff})-log (1 +z) plane. The flux PDF measurements are furthermore of interest for studies of the thermal state of the IGM at z≃ 3. By comparing the PDF to state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we place constraints on the temperature of the IGM and compare our results with previous measurements of the PDF at lower redshift. At redshift z= 3, our new PDF measurements are consistent with an isothermal temperature-density relation, T=T\textsubscript{0}∆\textsuperscript{γ- 1}, with a temperature at the mean density of T\textsubscript{0}= 19 250 ± 4800 K and a slope γ= 0.90 ± 0.21 (1σ uncertainties). In comparison, joint constraints with existing lower redshift PDF measurements at z \&lt; 3 favour an inverted temperature-density relation with T\textsubscript{0}= 17 900 ± 3500 K and γ= 0.70 ± 0.12, in broad agreement with previous analyses. \textsuperscript{ a }In some cases, the emission redshift z\textsubscript{em} estimated on the basis of the QSO Lyman $\alpha$ emission line is an underestimation of the true value (see K07).

  abstract = {We use data from the first-year observations of the DES collaboration to measure the galaxy angular power spectrum (APS), and search for its BAO feature. We test our methodology in a sample of 1800 DES Y1-like mock catalogues. We use the pseudo-C\textsubscript{ℓ} method to estimate the APS and the mock catalogues to estimate its covariance matrix. We use templates to model the measured spectra and estimate template parameters firstly from the C\textsubscript{ℓ}'s of the mocks using two different methods, a maximum likelihood estimator and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, finding consistent results with a good reduced χ\textsuperscript{2}. Robustness tests are performed to estimate the impact of different choices of settings used in our analysis. Finally, we apply our method to a galaxy sample constructed from DES Y1 data specifically for LSS studies. This catalogue comprises galaxies within an effective area of 1318 deg\textsuperscript{2} and 0.6 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.0. We find that the DES Y1 data favour a model with BAO at the 2.6 σ C.L. However, the goodness of fit is somewhat poor, with χ\textsuperscript{2}/(d.o.f.) = 1.49. We identify a possible cause showing that using a theoretical covariance matrix obtained from C\textsubscript{ℓ}'s that are better adjusted to data results in an improved value of χ\textsuperscript{2}/(dof) = 1.36 which is similar to the value obtained with the real-space analysis. Our results correspond to a distance measurement of D\textsubscript{A}(z\textsubscript{eff} = 0.81)/r\textsubscript{d} = 10.65 ± 0.49, consistent with the main DES BAO findings. This is a companion paper to the main DES BAO article showing the details of the harmonic space analysis.},

In practice, the problem is that the computational requirements for next-generation spectroscopic surveys such as Euclid and the Square Kilometre Array are currently unfeasible. We propose a new method to save computational time for spectroscopic angular power spectra. This hybrid method is modelled on the Fourier power spectrum approach of treating relatively thick redshift bins (∆z ̃ 0.1) as separate surveys. In the hybrid method, each thick bin is further subdivided into thin bins (δz ̃ 0.01); all the correlations within each thick bin are computed, whilst cross-bin correlations beyond the thick bins are neglected. Constraints on cosmological parameters from the hybrid method are comparable to those from the standard galaxy P\_g(k,z) analysis - but they have the advantage that cosmic evolution, wide-angle, and lensing effects are naturally included, whilst no Alcock-Paczynski correction is needed. The hybrid method delivers much tighter constraints than a 2D tomographic approach that is typical for photometric surveys, which considers only thick bins and the correlations between them. Furthermore, for standard cosmological parameters our method is not biased by neglecting the effects of lensing on number counts, whilst the tomographic method is strongly biased.},

Our photometric-classification method is based on the SN classification technique of Sako et al., aided by host-galaxy redshifts (0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.55). SuperNova ANAlysis simulations of our methodology estimate that we have an SN Ia classification efficiency of 70.8\%, with only 3.9\% contamination from core-collapse (non-Ia) SNe. We demonstrate that this level of contamination has no effect on our cosmological constraints. We quantify and correct for our selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias) using simulations. When fitting to a flat ΛCDM cosmological model, we find that our photometric sample alone gives Ω m  = 0.24+0.07 -0.05 (statistical errors only). If we relax the constraint on flatness, then our sample provides competitive joint statistical constraints on Ω m and ΩΛ, comparable to those derived from the spectroscopically confirmed Three-year Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3). Using only our data, the statistics-only result favors an accelerating universe at 99.96\% confidence. Assuming a constant wCDM cosmological model, and combining with H 0, cosmic microwave background, and luminous red galaxy data, we obtain w = -0.96+0.10 -0.10, Ω m = 0.29+0.02 -0.02, and Ω k = 0.00+0.03 -0.02 (statistical errors only), which is competitive with similar spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia analyses. Overall this comparison is reassuring, considering the lower redshift leverage of the SDSS-II SN sample (z {$<$} 0.55) and the lack of spectroscopic confirmation used herein. These results demonstrate the potential of photometrically classified SN Ia samples in improving cosmological constraints.},

To facilitate LSST planning we provide a range of possible LSST surveys with clear metrics based on the improvement in the Dark Energy figure of merit (FOM). To provide a quantifiable metric we present five survey options using only between 0.3 and 3.8\% of the LSST 10 year survey. We also provide information so that the LSST DDF cadence can possibly be matched to those of \textbackslash emph\{Euclid\} in common deep fields, SXDS, COSMOS, CDFS, and a proposed new LSST deep field (near the Akari Deep Field South). Co-coordination of observations from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid will lead to a significant number of synergies. The combination of optical multi-band imaging from LSST with high resolution optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from \textbackslash emph\{Euclid\} will not only improve constraints on Dark Energy, but provide a wealth of science on the Milky Way, local group, local large scale structure, and even on first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. A detailed paper has been published on the Dark Energy science case (Rhodes et al.) by a joint LSST/Euclid working group as well as a white paper describing LSST/Euclid/WFIRST synergies (Jain et al.), and we will briefly describe other science cases here. A companion white paper argues the general science case for an extension of the LSST footprint to the north at airmass {$<$} 1.8, and we support the white papers for southern extensions of the LSST survey.},

The present analyses make use of all-sky maps extracted via ray-tracing across the gravitational potential distribution provided by the "Dark Energy and Massive Neutrino Universe" (DEMNUni) project, a set of large-volume, high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations, where neutrinos are treated as separate collisionless particles. We correctly recover, at \$1-2\textbackslash\%\$ accuracy, the linear predictions from CAMB. Concerning the CMB-lensing and weak-lensing signals, we also recover, with similar accuracy, the signal predicted by Boltzmann codes, once non-linear neutrino corrections to Halofit are accounted for. Interestingly, in the ISW/Rees-Sciama signal, and its cross correlation with lensing, we find an excess of power with respect to the massless case, due to free streaming neutrinos, roughly at the transition scale between the linear and non-linear regimes. The excess is \$\textbackslash sim 5-10\textbackslash\%\$ at \$l\textbackslash sim 100\$ for the ISW/Rees-Sciama auto power spectrum, depending on the total neutrino mass \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$, and becomes a factor of \$\textbackslash sim 4\$ for \$M\_\textbackslash nu=0.3\$ eV, at \$l\textbackslash sim 600\$, for the ISW/Rees-Sciama cross power with CMB-lensing. This effect should be taken into account for the correct estimation of the CMB temperature bispectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos.},

One of the key features of our method is that we naturally recover the Zel'dovich approximation as the lowest order of our expansion for the matter correlation function. We compare our results against a suite of N-body simulations and obtain good agreement for the correlation functions in real space and for the monopole correlation function in redshift space. The agreement becomes worse for higher multipole moments of the redshift-space, halo correlation function. Our formalism naturally includes non-linear bias and explains the strong bias-dependence of the multipole moments of the redshift-space correlation function seen in N-body simulations.},

  abstract = {We have analysed 18 ALMA continuum maps in Bands 6 and 7, with rms down to 7.8 μJy, to derive differential number counts down to 60 μJy and 100 μJy at λ = 1.3 mm and λ = 1.1 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the non-detection of faint sources in the deepest ALMA field enabled us to set tight upper limits on the number counts down to 30 μJy. This is a factor of four deeper than the currently most stringent upper limit. The area covered by the combined fields is 9.5 × 10\textsuperscript{-4} deg\textsuperscript{2} at 1.1 mm and 6.6 × 10\textsuperscript{-4} deg\textsuperscript{2} at 1.3 mm. With respect to previous works, we improved the source extraction method by requiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with the beam size. This method enabled us to remove spurious detections that have plagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. We detected 50 faint sources (at fluxes \&lt;1 mJy) with signal-to-noise (S/N) \&gt;3.5 down to 60 μJy, hence improving the statistics by a factor of four relative to previous studies. The inferred differential number counts are dN/ d(Log\textsubscript{10}S) = 1 × 10\textsuperscript{5} deg\textsuperscript{2} at a 1.1 mm flux S\textsubscript{λ = 1.1 mm} = 130 μJy, and dN/ d(Log\textsubscript{10}S) = 1.1 × 10\textsuperscript{5} deg\textsuperscript{2} at a 1.3 mm flux S\textsubscript{λ = 1.3 mm} = 60 μJy. At the faintest flux limits probed by our data, i.e. 30 μJy and 40 μJy, we obtain upper limits on the differential number counts of dN/ d(Log\textsubscript{10}S) \&lt; 7 × 10\textsuperscript{5} deg\textsuperscript{2} and dN/ d(Log\textsubscript{10}S) \&lt; 3 × 10\textsuperscript{5} deg\textsuperscript{2}, respectively. Determining the fraction of cosmic infrared background (CIB) resolved by the ALMA observations was hampered by the large uncertainties plaguing the CIB measurements (a factor of four in flux). However, our results provide a new lower limit to CIB intensity of 17.2 Jy deg\textsuperscript{-2} at 1.1 mm and of 12.9 Jy deg\textsuperscript{-2} at 1.3 mm. Moreover, the flattening of the integrated number counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close to the CIB intensity. Our data imply that galaxies with star formation rate (SFR) \&lt; 40 M\textsubscript{☉}/yr certainly contribute less than 50\% to the CIB (and probably a much lower percentage) while more than 50\% of the CIB must be produced by galaxies with SFR\&gt; 40 M\textsubscript{☉}/yr. The differential number counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models of galaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. Consequently, this supports the galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.},

  abstract = {We propose a new sequential classification model for astronomical objects based on a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) which uses sequences of images as inputs. This approach avoids the computation of light curves or difference images. This is the first time that sequences of images are used directly for the classification of variable objects in astronomy. The second contribution of this work is the image simulation process. We generate synthetic image sequences which take into account the instrumental and observing conditions, obtaining a realistic, unevenly sampled, and variable noise set of movies for each astronomical object. The simulated data set is used to train our RCNN classifier. This approach allows us to generate data sets to train and test our RCNN model for different astronomical surveys and telescopes. Moreover, using a simulated data set is faster and more adaptable to different surveys and classification tasks. We aim to build a simulated data set whose distribution is close enough to the real data set, so that fine tuning could match the distributions. To test the RCNN classifier trained with the synthetic data set, we used real-world data from the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS), obtaining an average recall of 85\%, improved to 94\% after performing fine tuning with 10 real samples per class. We compare the results of our RCNN model with those of a light curve random forest classifier. The proposed RCNN with fine tuning has a similar performance on the HiTS data set compared to the light curve random forest classifier, trained on an augmented training set with 10 real samples per class. The RCNN approach presents several advantages in an alert stream classification scenario, such as a reduction of the data pre-processing, faster online evaluation, and easier performance improvement using a few real data samples. The results obtained encourage us to use the proposed method for astronomical alert broker systems that will process alert streams generated by new telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

  abstract = {Standard analysis pipelines for measurements of Baryon Acoustic  Oscillations (BAO) in galaxy surveys make use of a fiducial cosmological model to guide the data compression required to transform from observed redshifts and angles to the measured angular and radial BAO peak positions. In order to remove any dependence on the fiducial cosmology from the results, all models compared to the data should mimic the compression and its dependence on the fiducial model. In practice, approximations are made when testing models: (1) There is assumed to be no residual dependence on the fiducial cosmology after reconstruction, (2) differences in the distance-redshift relationship are assumed to match a linear scaling, and (3) differences in clustering between true and fiducial models are assumed to be removed by the free parameters used to null the non-BAO signal. We test these approximations using the current standard measurement procedure with a set of halo catalogues from the aemulus suite of N-body simulations, which span a range of wCDM cosmological models. We focus on reconstruction of the primordial BAO and locating the BAO. For the range of wCDM cosmologies covered by the aemulus suite, we find no evidence for systematic errors in the measured BAO shift parameters $\alpha$∥ and $\alpha$⊥ to {$<$} 0.1\%. However, the measured errors σ$\alpha$\textbackslash parallel and σ\&alpha/\textbackslash bot show a notable absolute increase by up to +0.001 and +0.002, respectively, in the case that the fiducial cosmology does not match the truth. These effects on the inferred BAO scale will be important, given the precision of measurements expected from future surveys including DESI, Euclid, and WFIRST.},

  abstract = {Low-redshift measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measure the late-time evolution of the Universe and are a vital probe of dark energy. Over the past decade both the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS MGS) have provided important distance constraints at z \&lt; 0.3. In this paper we re-evaluate the cosmological information from the BAO detection in 6dFGS making use of halo occupation distribution (HOD)-populated COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) mocks for an accurate covariance matrix and take advantage of the now commonly implemented technique of density field reconstruction. For the 6dFGS data, we find consistency with the previous analysis, and obtain an isotropic volume-averaged distance measurement of D\textsubscript{V}(z\_\{eff\}=0.097) = [372± 17(± \^\{98\}\_\{33\})](r\textsubscript{s}/r\textsubscript{s}\^\{fid\}) Mpc but with a highly non-Gaussian likelihood. We combine our measurement from both the post-reconstruction clustering of 6dFGS and SDSS MGS offering an updated constraint in this redshift regime, D\textsubscript{V}(z\_\{eff\}=0.122)=[539± 17(± \^\{35\}\_\{39\})](r\textsubscript{s}/r\^\{fid\}\textsubscript{s}) Mpc. This measurement tightens the constraint in comparison to the result from SDSS MGS alone, especially at the 2σ and higher significance levels. These measurements are consistent with standard Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) and after fixing the standard ruler using a Planck prior on Ω\textsubscript{m}h\textsuperscript{2}, the joint analysis gives H\textsubscript{0}=64.0± 3.5 km s\^\{-1\} Mpc\^\{-1\}. This result is consistent with other BAO and Cosmic microwave background (CMB) studies but is in \&gt;2σ tension with supernova distance ladder measurements. In the near future both the Taipan Galaxy Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will improve this measurement to 1\% at low redshift.},

  abstract = {We analyse the clustering features of Large Scale Structures (LSS) in the presence of massive neutrinos, employing a set of large-volume, high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations, where neutrinos are treated as separate collisionless particles. The volume of 8 h-3 Gpc3, combined with a resolution of about 8×1010h-1M⊚ for the cold dark matter (CDM) component, represents a significant improvement over previous N-body simulations in massive neutrino cosmologies. In this work we focus, in the first place, on the analysis of nonlinear effects in CDM and neutrinos perturbations contributing to the total matter power spectrum. We show that most of the nonlinear evolution is generated exclusively by the CDM component. We therefore compare mildly nonlinear predictions from Eulerian Perturbation Theory (PT), and fully nonlinear prescriptions (HALOFIT) with the measurements obtained from the simulations. We find that accounting only for the nonlinear evolution of the CDM power spectrum allows to recover the total matter power spectrum with the same accuracy as the massless case. Indeed, we show that, the most recent version of the (HALOFIT) formula calibrated on ΛCDM simulations can be applied directly to the linear CDM power spectrum without requiring additional fitting parameters in the massive case. As a second step, we study the abundance and clustering properties of CDM halos, confirming that, in massive neutrino cosmologies, the proper definition of the halo bias should be made with respect to the cold rather than the total matter distribution, as recently shown in the literature. Here we extend these results to the redshift space, finding that, when accounting for massive neutrinos, an improper definition of the linear bias can lead to a systematic error of about 1-2 \% in the determination of the linear growth rate from anisotropic clustering. This result is quite important if we consider that future spectroscopic galaxy surveys, as e.g. Euclid, are expected to measure the linear growth-rate with statistical errors less than about 3 \% at z≲1.},

This becomes important when the line-of-sight direction varies significantly across a survey, leading to what are known as ‘wide-angle’ effects in redshift-space distortions. Wide-angle effects will also be present in measurements of the momentum field, i.e. the galaxy density-weighted velocity field, in upcoming peculiar velocity surveys. In this work, we study how wide-angle effects modify the predicted correlation function and power spectrum for momentum statistics, both in autocorrelation and in cross-correlation with the density field. Using both linear theory and the Zel’dovich approximation, we find that deviations from the plane-parallel limit are large and could become important in data analysis for low-redshift surveys. We point out that even multipoles in the cross-correlation between density and momentum are non-zero regardless of the choice of line of sight, and therefore contain new cosmological information that could be exploited. We discuss configuration space, Fourier space, and spherical analyses; providing exact expressions in each case rather than relying on an expansion in small angles. We hope these expressions will be of use in the analysis of upcoming surveys for redshift-space distortions and peculiar velocities.},

  abstract = {We have supplemented our code, which computes the evolution of the  physical state of a representative piece of the universe to include, not only the dynamics of dark matter (with a standard PM code), and the hydrodynamics of the gaseous component (including detailed collisional and radiative processes), but also galaxy formation on a heuristic but plausible basis. If, within a cell the gas is Jeans unstable, collapsing, and cooling rapidly, it is transformed to galaxy subunits, which are then followed with a collisionless code. These particles emit UV radiation and supernova blasts with energy efficiencies (in units of mc2) equal to (ɛUV, ɛSN) = (10-4 , 10-4.5). This energy input significantly alters some aspects of the simulation; the primary consequences are to heat and ionize the gas at a much earlier epoch than if stellar feedback were ignored. We study two representative boxes with sizes L = (80, 8)h-1 Mpc, in both cases utilizing a 2003 mesh containing 2003 dark matter particles and having nominal resolutions of (400, 40)h-1 kpc, respectively, with true resolution approximately 2.5 times worse. We adopt the standard CDM perturbation spectrum with an amplitude of σ8 ≡ (δM/M)rms,8 = 0.77, a compromise between the COBE normalization σ8 = 1.05 and that indicated by the small-scale velocity dispersion (perhaps σ8 = 0.45). We find that by the time that 0.2\% of the baryons have been transformed to stars at redshift 8.6, reionization is ½ complete, and observed Gunn-Peterson limits to a redshift of Ζ = 5 are satisfied. Very hot (107 - 108 K) gas is produced by shocks in the clusters, lower temperature (106 K) gas from supernova-fed superwinds is in lower density filaments and sheets and photo-heated gas (104-105 K) fills the voids. The mass fractions in these components at redshift zero being roughly (29\%, 40\%, 31\%) correspond to gas in the temperature ranges ({$<$}105.5, 105.5-106.5, {$>$}106.5) K. In rich clusters the galaxy and dark matter densities are more concentrated than the gas density in agreement with gravitational lens observations. We can combine the observed and computed baryon to total mass ratios with Ωb from light element nucleosynthesis, and we conclude that we live in an open universe with Ωtot = (0.11, 0.24) for h = (1.0, 0.5). While the correspondence between the thermodynamic properties of gas and radiation fields of this CDM model and the real world can be taken as support for the former, it is likely that many of the attributes of this simulation are generic, the result of a detailed physical treatment of atomic processes, and will be found as well in rival cosmological models.},

  abstract = {If gravitational clustering is a hierarchical process, the present  large-scale structure of the galaxy distribution implies that structures on smaller scales must have formed at high redshift. We simulate the formation of small-scale structure (average cell mass: (delta) bar mb = 104.2 solar mass) and the evolution of photoionized gas, in the specific case of the CDM + Lambda model. The photoionized gas has a natural minimal scale of collapse, the Jeans scale (mb,J is approximately equal to 109 solar mass). We find that low column density (NHI is less than or equal to 1014/sq cm) lines originate in regions resembling Zel'dovich pancakes, where gas with overdensities in the range 3-30 is enclosed by two shocks but is typically reexpanding at approximately the Hubble velocity. However, higher column density lines stem from more overdense regions where the shocked gas is cooling. We show that this model can probably account for the observed number of lines, their distribution in column density and b-parameters, as well as the cloud physical sizes as observed in gravitationally lensed quasars. We find a redshift evolution that is too steep; however, this may be due to insufficient dynamical range in the simulation or because the specific model is incorrect. The model predicts that high signal-to-noise observations should find systematic deviations from Voigt profiles, mainly in the form of broad wings in the line profiles, and that a fluctuating Gunn-Peterson effect will be detected, which can be modeled as a superposition of weak lines with a wide range of b-parameters.},

  abstract = {The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest is a powerful probe for cosmology, but it is also strongly impacted by galaxy evolution and baryonic processes such as active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, which can redistribute mass and energy on large scales. We constrain the signatures of AGN feedback on the 1D power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest using a series of eight hydro-cosmological simulations performed with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. This series starts from the Horizon-AGN simulation and varies the subgrid parameters for AGN feeding, feedback, and stochasticity. These simulations cover the whole plausible range of feedback and feeding parameters according to the resulting galaxy properties. AGNs globally suppress the Lyman-$\alpha$ power at all scales. On large scales, the energy injection and ionization dominate over the supply of gas mass from AGN-driven galactic winds, thus suppressing power. On small scales, faster cooling of denser gas mitigates the suppression. This effect increases with decreasing redshift. We provide lower and upper limits of this signature at nine redshifts between z = 4.25 and 2.0, making it possible to account for it at post-processing stage in future work given that running simulations without AGN feedback can save considerable amounts of computing resources. Ignoring AGN feedback in cosmological inference analyses leads to strong biases with 2 per cent shift on σ8 and 1 per cent shift on ns, which represents twice the standards deviation of the current constraints on ns.},

  abstract = {For Gaussian primordial fluctuations the relationship between galaxy and matter overdensities, bias, is most often assumed to be local at the time of observation in the large-scale limit. This hypothesis is however unstable under time evolution, we provide proofs under several (increasingly more realistic) sets of assumptions. In the simplest toy model galaxies are created locally and linearly biased at a single formation time, and subsequently move with the dark matter (no velocity bias) conserving their comoving number density (no merging). We show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes unavoidably nonlocal and nonlinear at large scales. We identify the nonlocal gravitationally induced fields in which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded, showing that they can be constructed out of the invariants of the deformation tensor (Galileons), the main signature of which is a quadrupole field in second-order perturbation theory. In addition, we show that this result persists if we include an arbitrary evolution of the comoving number density of tracers. We then include velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear; these are related to the breaking of Galilean invariance of the bias relation, a dipole field being the signature at second order. We test these predictions by studying the dependence of halo overdensities in cells of fixed dark matter density: measurements in simulations show that departures from the mean bias relation are strongly correlated with the nonlocal gravitationally induced fields identified by our formalism, suggesting that the halo distribution at the present time is indeed more closely related to the mass distribution at an earlier rather than present time. However, the nonlocality seen in the simulations is not fully captured by assuming local bias in Lagrangian space. The effects on nonlocal bias seen in the simulations are most important for the most biased halos, as expected from our predictions. Accounting for these effects when modeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing the dependence on triangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum, and hence constraining cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that using our formalism we remove an important systematic in the determination of bias parameters from the galaxy bispectrum, particularly for luminous galaxies.},

We also fit to the data using the full range of scales \$0.1-60\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc modelled by the Aemulus cosmological emulator and find a \$4.5\textbackslash sigma\$ tension in the amplitude of the halo velocity field with the Planck+\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, driven by a mismatch on the non-linear scales. This may not be cosmological in origin, and could be due to a breakdown in the Halo Occupation Distribution model used in the emulator. Finally, we perform a robust analysis of possible sources of systematics, including the effects of redshift uncertainty and incompleteness due to target selection that were not included in previous analyses fitting to clustering measurements on small scales.},

  abstract = {The quasar target selection for the upcoming survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will be fixed for the next five years. The aim of this work is to validate the quasar selection by studying the impact of imaging systematics as well as stellar and galactic contaminants, and to develop a procedure to mitigate them. Density fluctuations of quasar targets are found to be related to photometric properties such as seeing and depth of the Data Release 9 of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. To model this complex relation, we explore machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron) as an alternative to the standard linear regression. Splitting the footprint of the Legacy Imaging Surveys into three regions according to photometric properties, we perform an independent analysis in each region, validating our method using eBOSS EZ-mocks. The mitigation procedure is tested by comparing the angular correlation of the corrected target selection on each photometric region to the angular correlation function obtained using quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)Data Release 16. With our procedure, we recover a similar level of correlation between DESI quasar targets and SDSS quasars in two thirds of the total footprint and we show that the excess of correlation in the remaining area is due to a stellar contamination which should be removed with DESI spectroscopic data. We derive the Limber parameters in our three imaging regions and compare them to previous measurements from SDSS and the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey.},

  abstract = {A long-standing issue in peculiar velocity cosmology is whether the halo/galaxy velocity bias bv = 1 at large scale. The resolution of this important issue must resort to high-precision cosmological simulations. However, this is hampered by another long-standing “sampling artifact” problem in volume-weighted velocity measurement. We circumvent this problem with a hybrid approach. We first measure the statistics free of sampling artifacts, then link them to volume-weighted statistics in theory, and finally solve for the velocity bias. bv (determined by our method) is not only free of sampling artifacts but also free of cosmic variance. We apply this method to a ΛCDM N-body simulation of 30723 particles and box size. For the first time, we determine the halo velocity bias to 0.1\%–1\% accuracy. Our major findings are as follows: (1) at . The deviation from unity () increases with k. Depending on halo mass and redshift, it may reach at and at . The discovered has a statistically significant impact on the structure growth rate measurement by spectroscopic redshift surveys, including DESI, Euclid, and SKA. (2) Both the sign and the amplitude of bv − 1 depend on mass and redshift. These results disagree with the peak model prediction in that bv has much weaker deviation from unity, varies with redshift, and can be bigger than unity. (3) Most of the mass and redshift dependences can be compressed into a single dependence on the halo density bias. Based on this finding, we provide an approximate two-parameter fitting formula.},

We describe how the large-scale correlations in the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest can be understood as an expansion in cumulants of the optical depth field, which itself can be related to the density field by a bias expansion. This provides a direct connection between the observable and the statistics of the matter fluctuations which can be computed in a systematic manner. We discuss the way in which complex, small-scale physics enters the predictions, the origin of the much-discussed velocity bias and the `renormalization' of the large-scale bias coefficients. Our calculations are within the context of perturbation theory, but we also make contact with earlier work using the peak-background split. Using the structure of the equations of motion we demonstrate, to all orders in perturbation theory, that the large-scale flux power spectrum becomes the linear spectrum times the square of a quadratic in the cosine of the angle to the line of sight. Unlike the case of galaxies, both the isotropic and anisotropic pieces receive contributions from small-scale physics.},

  abstract = {We study synergies between three promising methods to measure 2\&lt;z\&lt;5 large-scale structure in the next decade. Optical spectroscopic surveys are the most mature, but become increasingly difficult at z\&gt;2 and suffer from interloper problems even for spectroscopic surveys. Intensity mapping of the 21-cm signal can cover large volumes with exquisite fidelity, but is limited both by loss of information to foreground cleaning and by lack of knowledge of the mean signal. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is theoretically very clean, but ultimately measures just the projected variations in density. We find that cross-correlation between optical and radio can significantly improve the measurement of growth rate. Combining these with the CMB provides a promising avenue to detecting modified gravity at high redshifts, in particular by independently probing the Weyl and Newtonian potentials and by strengthening control of systematics. We find that cross-correlating a Stage \{\textbackslash sc ii\} 21-cm survey with DESI quasars with a reasonable brightness temperature prior could enable measurements of the growth rate fσ\textsubscript{8} at sub 3\% and sub 8\% levels at z = 3, 4, representing a factor of 4 and 8 improvement over constraints obtainable from DESI quasars alone. Similarly, cross-correlating 21-cm data with a futuristic LBG survey to m\textsubscript{UV}\&lt;24.5 over 1000 square degrees will make possible fσ\textsubscript{8} measurements at close to 1\% at z = 3 and 3\% at z = 4, and improve similar constraints at z = 5 by close to a factor of 3 to sub-10\% precision. Combining the above with CMB lensing from a Stage 4 CMB survey and LSST data can additionally constrain the gravitational slip γ parameter to similar precision at these redshifts, enabling us to test the predictions of general relativity at large scales. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cosmic photons can be efficiently collected by broadband intensity mapping but information on their emission redshift and frequency is largely lost. We introduce a technique to statistically recover these otherwise collapsed dimensions by exploiting information in spatial fluctuations and apply it to the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) All Sky and Medium Imaging Surveys. By spatially cross-correlating photons in the GALEX far-UV (1500 Å) and near-UV (2300 Å) bands with a million spectroscopic objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of redshift, we robustly detect the redshift-dependent intensity of the UV background (UVB) modulated by its clustering bias up to z ̃ 2. These measurements clearly reveal the imprints of UVB spectral features redshifting through the filters. Using a simple parameterization, we simultaneously fit a UVB emissivity and clustering bias factor to these observations and constrain the main spectral features of the UVB spectrum: (i) the Lyman break, (ii) the non-ionizing UV continuum, which agrees with the Haardt \&amp; Madau model but does not rely on any assumption regarding the nature of the sources, and (iii) the Ly$\alpha$ emission, the luminosity density of which is consistent with estimates of the combined galaxy and active galactic nucleus contributions at z ̃ 1. Because the technique probes the total background including low surface brightness emission, we place constraints on the amount of UV light originating from the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Finally, the clustering bias of UV photons is found to be chromatic and evolving. Our frequency- and redshift-dependent UVB measurement delivers a summary statistic of the universe’s net radiation output from stars, black holes, and the IGM combined.},

Fiducial specifications for the expected galaxy distributions for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are also included, together with the capability of computing redshift distributions for a user-defined photometric redshift model. A rigorous validation procedure, based on comparisons between CCL and independent software packages, allows us to establish a well-defined numerical accuracy for each predicted quantity. As a result, predictions for correlation functions of galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear are demonstrated to be within a fraction of the expected statistical uncertainty of the observables for the models and in the range of scales of interest to LSST.

We provide accurate measurements \{D\vphantom\}\textsubscript{A}(0.59)r\textsubscript{s,fid}/r\textsubscript{s}, H(0.59)r\textsubscript{s}/r\textsubscript{s,fid}, f(0.59)σ\textsubscript{8}(0.59), Ω\textsubscript{m} h\textsuperscript{2}\vphantom\{\} = \{1427 ± 26 Mpc, 97.3 ± 3.3 km s\vphantom\}\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, 0.488 ± 0.060, 0.135 ± 0.016\vphantom\{\}, where r\textsubscript{s} is the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch and r\textsubscript{s,fid} = 147.66 Mpc is the sound scale of the fiducial cosmology used in this study. The parameters which are not well constrained by our galaxy clustering analysis are marginalized over with wide flat priors. Since no priors from other data sets, e.g. cosmic microwave background (CMB), are adopted and no dark energy models are assumed, our results from BOSS CMASS galaxy clustering alone may be combined with other data sets, I.e. CMB, SNe, lensing or other galaxy clustering data to constrain the parameters of a given cosmological model. The uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, from CMB+CMASS is about 8 per cent. The uncertainty on the curvature fraction, Ω\textsubscript{k}, is 0.3 per cent. We do not find deviation from flat ΛCDM.},

The comparison is done for two-point (power spectrum and two-point correlation function in real and redshift space), and the three-point clustering statistics (bispectrum and three-point correlation function). The reference catalogues are drawn from the BigMultiDark N-body simulation. Both friend-of-friends (including distinct haloes only) and spherical overdensity (including distinct haloes and subhalos) catalogues have been used with the typical number density of a large volume galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the power spectrum at quasi-linear and even smaller scales. With respect to various clustering statistics, a methodology based on perturbation theory and a realistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with N-body simulations. However, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum, only the method based on semi-N-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1 per cent level) at small scales, i.e. r \&lt; 25 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc or k \&gt; 0.15 h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}. Full N-body solutions will remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the more efficient approximate solvers can reach a few per cent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scales interesting for the large-scale structure analysis.

We focus on characterizing statistics relevant to emission line and luminous red galaxies in the current and upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. We use a suite of precise particle mesh simulations (FASTPM) as well as with full N-body calculations with a mass resolution of \{̃ \} 1.2× 10\^9 h\^\{-1\}M\textsubscript{☉} to investigate the recently suggested technique of Angulo and Pontzen to suppress the variance of cosmological simulations. We study redshift-space distortions, cosmic voids, higher order statistics from z = 2 down to 0. We find that both two- and three-point statistics are unbiased. Over the scales of interest for baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, we find that the variance is greatly reduced in the two-point statistics and in the cross-correlation between haloes and cosmic voids, but is not reduced significantly for the three-point statistics. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the two-point correlation function for a galaxy survey with effective volume of 20 (h\textsuperscript{-1}Gpc)\textsuperscript{3} is improved by about a factor of 40, indicating that two pairs of simulations with a volume of 1 (h\textsuperscript{-1}Gpc)\textsuperscript{3} lead to the equivalent variance of ̃150 such simulations. The N-body simulations presented here thus provide an effective survey volume of about seven times the effective survey volume of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument or Euclid.

Starting with the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation applied to the smoothed total density field in real-space, and progressing through redshift-space with no thermal broadening, redshift-space with thermal broadening and hydrodynamically simulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the literature fare. We find that Seljak's 2012 analytical formulae for these bias parameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and linear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his b\textsubscript{η} formula is exact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal broadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of large-scale measurements of b\textsubscript{η} and the small scale flux PDF might be a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale biases derived from the smoothed total matter field are within 10-20\% to those based on hydrodynamical quantities, in line with other measurements in the literature. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

Large-scale structure surveys, such as the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), have collected quasar (QSO) spectra that enable the reconstruction of H I density fluctuations. The data fall on a collection of lines defined by the lines of sight (LOS) of the QSO, and a major issue with producing a 3D reconstruction is determining how to model the regions between the LOS. We present a method that produces a 3D map of this relatively uncharted portion of the Universe by employing local polynomial smoothing, a non-parametric methodology. The performance of the method is analysed on simulated data that mimics the varying number of LOS expected in real data, and then is applied to a sample region selected from BOSS. Evaluation of the reconstruction is assessed by considering various features of the predicted 3D maps including visual comparison of slices, probability density functions (PDFs), counts of local minima and maxima, and standardized correlation functions. This 3D reconstruction allows for an initial investigation of the topology of this portion of the Universe using persistent homology.},

  abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF Galaxy Redshift  Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are Ωmh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a baryon fraction Ωb/Ωm= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1σ errors). The value of Ωmh is 1σ lower than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard Ωm= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer Ωm= 0.231 +/- 0.021.},

Difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations such as the fact that the LN model is not completely specified by its moments have been revealed by analysis of the model.

We construct a 'residual' statistic sensitive to systematic shifts in their brightness in different directions and use this to search in different redshift slices for a preferred direction on the sky in which the SNe Ia are brighter or fainter relative to the standard Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. At low redshift (z {$<$} 0.05), we find that an isotropic model such as ΛCDM is barely consistent with the SNe Ia data at 2σ-3σ. A maximum-likelihood analysis of peculiar velocities confirms this finding - there is a bulk flow of 260 km s-1 extending out to z∼ 0.06, which disagrees with ΛCDM at 1σ-2σ. Since the Shapley concentration is believed to be largely responsible for this bulk flow, we make a detailed study of the infall region: the SNe Ia falling away from the Local Group towards Shapley are indeed significantly dimmer than those falling towards us on to Shapley. Convergence to the CMB rest frame must occur well beyond Shapley (z {$>$} 0.06) so this low-redshift bulk flow will systematically bias any reconstruction of the expansion history of the Universe. At higher redshifts z {$>$} 0.15 the agreement between the SNe Ia data and the ΛCDM model does improve, however, the sparseness and low quality of the data mean that the latter cannot be singled out as the preferred cosmological model.},

  abstract = {Euclid is a mission of the European Space Agency that is designed to constrain the properties of dark energy and gravity via weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. It will carry out a wide area imaging and spectroscopy survey (the Euclid Wide Survey: EWS) in visible and near-infrared bands, covering approximately 15 000 deg\textsuperscript{2} of extragalactic sky in six years. The wide-field telescope and instruments are optimised for pristine point spread function and reduced stray light, producing very crisp images. This paper presents the building of the Euclid reference survey: the sequence of pointings of EWS, deep fields, and calibration fields, as well as spacecraft movements followed by Euclid as it operates in a step-and-stare mode from its orbit around the Lagrange point L2. Each EWS pointing has four dithered frames; we simulated the dither pattern at the pixel level to analyse the effective coverage. We used up-to-date models for the sky background to define the Euclid region-of-interest (RoI). The building of the reference survey is highly constrained from calibration cadences, spacecraft constraints, and background levels; synergies with ground-based coverage were also considered. Via purposely built software, we first generated a schedule for the calibrations and deep fields observations. On a second stage, the RoI was tiled and scheduled with EWS observations, using an algorithm optimised to prioritise the best sky areas, produce a compact coverage, and ensure thermal stability. The result is the optimised reference survey RSD\_2021A, which fulfils all constraints and is a good proxy for the final solution. The current EWS covers ≈14 500 deg\textsuperscript{2}. The limiting AB magnitudes (5σ point-like source) achieved in its footprint are estimated to be 26.2 (visible band I\textsubscript{E}) and 24.5 (for near infrared bands Y\textsubscript{E}, J\textsubscript{E}, H\textsubscript{E}); for spectroscopy, the H$\alpha$ line flux limit is 2 × 10\textsuperscript{−16} erg\textsuperscript{−1} cm\textsuperscript{−2} s\textsuperscript{−1} at 1600 nm; and for diffuse emission, the surface brightness limits are 29.8 (visible band) and 28.4 (near infrared bands) mag arcsec\textsuperscript{−2}.},

The current surveys covering a comoving volume sufficient to unveil the BAO scale are limited to redshift z ≲ 0.7. In this paper, we study several galaxy selection schemes aiming at building an emission-line galaxy (ELG) sample in the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.7 that would be suitable for future BAO studies using the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectrograph on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) telescope. We explore two different colour selections using both the SDSS and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHT-LS) photometry in the u, g, r and i bands and evaluate their performance selecting luminous ELGs. From about 2000 ELGs, we identified a selection scheme that has a 75 per cent redshift measurement efficiency. This result confirms the feasibility of massive ELG surveys using the BOSS spectrograph on the SDSS telescope for a BAO detection at z ˜ 1, in particular the proposed eBOSS experiment, which plans to use the SDSS telescope to combine the use of the BAO ruler with redshift space distortions using ELGs and quasars in the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2.},

  abstract = {The next generation of wide-field spectroscopic redshift surveys will  map the large-scale galaxy distribution in the redshift range 0.7 ≤ z ≤ 2 to measure baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The primary optical signature used in this redshift range comes from the [Oii] emission line doublet, which provides a unique redshift identification that can minimize confusion with other single emission lines. To derive the required spectrograph resolution for these redshift surveys, we simulate observations of the [Oii] (λλ 3727, 3729) doublet for various instrument resolutions, and line velocities. We foresee two strategies for the choice of the resolution for future spectrographs for BAO surveys. For bright [Oii] emitter surveys ([Oii] flux \textasciitilde 30 × 10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 like SDSS-IV/eBOSS), a resolution of R \textasciitilde{} 3300 allows the separation of 90 percent of the doublets. The impact of the sky lines on the completeness in redshift is less than 6 percent. For faint [Oii] emitter surveys ([Oii] flux \textasciitilde 10 × 10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 like DESi), the detection improves continuously with resolution, so we recommend the highest possible resolution, the limit being given by the number of pixels (4k by 4k) on the detector and the number of spectroscopic channels (2 or 3).},

To test different ELG selection algorithms, 9000 spectra were observed with the SDSS spectrograph as a pilot survey based on data from several imaging surveys. First, using visual inspection and redshift quality flags, we show that the automated spectroscopic redshifts assigned by the pipeline meet the quality requirements for a reliable BAO measurement. We also show the correlations between sky emission, signal-to-noise ratio in the emission lines, and redshift error. Then we provide a detailed description of each target selection algorithm we tested and compare them with the requirements of the eBOSS experiment. As a result, we provide reliable redshift distributions for the different target selection schemes we tested. Finally, we determine an target selection algorithms that is best suited to be applied on DECam photometry because they fulfill the eBOSS survey efficiency requirements.

We study here several galaxy selection schemes, aiming at building an emission-line galaxy (ELG) sample in the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.7, that would be suitable for future BAO studies, providing a highly biased galaxy sample. We analyse the angular galaxy clustering of galaxy selections at the redshifts 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1 and 1.2 and we combine this analysis with a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model to derive the properties of the haloes these galaxies inhabit, in particular the galaxy bias on large scales. We also perform a weak lensing analysis (aperture statistics) to extract the galaxy bias and the cross-correlation coefficient and compare to the HOD prediction. We apply this analysis on a data set composed of the photometry of the deep co-addition on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 (225 deg2), of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/Stripe 82 deep i-band weak lensing survey and of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer infrared photometric band W1. The analysis on the SDSS-III/constant mass galaxies selection at z = 0.5 is in agreement with previous studies on the tracer, moreover we measure its cross-correlation coefficient r = 1.16 ± 0.35. For the higher redshift bins, we confirm the trends that the brightest galaxy populations selected are strongly biased (b {$>$} 1.5), but we are limited by current data sets depth to derive precise values of the galaxy bias. A survey using such tracers of the mass field will guarantee a high significance detection of the BAO.},

We study the growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift z = 0.9 using more than 162 000 galaxy redshifts from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We divide the data into four redshift slices with effective redshifts z = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.76] and in each of the samples measure and model the two-point galaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to the line of sight. After simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor we recover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20 per cent in each redshift slice. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details of the assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making close comparison with a set of N-body simulations for calibration. Our measurements are consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similar data set, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. We determine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametric manner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, and investigate the Alcock-Paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial model on the results. Our techniques should prove useful for current and future galaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the two-dimensional correlation function.},

  abstract = {The formation and evolution of galaxies require large reservoirs of cold, neutral gas. The damped Lya systems (DLAs), seen in absorption towards distant quasars and gamma-ray bursts, are predicted to be the dominant reservoirs for this gas. Detailed properties of DLAs have been studied extensively for decades with great success. However, their size, fundamental in understanding their nature, has remained elusive, as quasar and gamma-ray-burst sightlines only probe comparatively tiny areas of the foreground DLAs. Here, we introduce a new approach to measure the full extent of DLAs in the sightlines toward extended background sources. We present the discovery of a high-column-density (log N(HI) = 21.1 +/-0.4 cm\^-2) DLA at z \textasciitilde{} 2.4 covering 90-100\% of the luminous extent of a line-of-sight background galaxy. Estimates of the size of the background galaxy range from a minimum of a few kpc\^2, to \textasciitilde 100 kpc\^2, and demonstrate that high-column density neutral gas can span continuous areas 10\^8 - 10\^10 times larger than previously explored in quasar or gamma-ray burst sightlines. The DLA presented here is the first from a sample of DLAs in our pilot survey that searches Lyman break and Lyman continuum galaxies at high redshift. The low luminosities, large sizes, and mass contents ({$>\sptilde$}10\^6 - 10\^9 M\_solar) implied by this DLA and the early data suggest that DLAs contain the necessary fuel for galaxies, with many systems consistent with relatively massive, low-luminosity primeval galaxies.},

  abstract = {We report a reanalysis of a near-pristine absorption system, located at a redshift z\_abs=2.52564 toward the quasar Q1243+307, based on the combination of archival and new data obtained with the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck telescope. This absorption system, which has an oxygen abundance [O/H]=-2.769+/-0.028 (\textasciitilde 1/600 of the Solar abundance), is among the lowest metallicity systems currently known where a precise measurement of the deuterium abundance is afforded. Our detailed analysis of this system concludes, on the basis of eight D I absorption lines, that the deuterium abundance of this gas cloud is log\_10(D/H) = -4.622+/-0.015, which is in very good agreement with the results previously reported by Kirkman et al. (2003), but with an improvement on the precision of this single measurement by a factor of \textasciitilde 3.5. Combining this new estimate with our previous sample of six high precision and homogeneously analyzed D/H measurements, we deduce that the primordial deuterium abundance is log\_10(D/H)\_P = -4.5974+/-0.0052 or, expressed as a linear quantity, (D/H)\_P = (2.527+/-0.030)x10\^-5; this value corresponds to a one percent determination of the primordial deuterium abundance. Combining our result with a BBN calculation that uses the latest nuclear physics input, we find that the baryon density derived from BBN agrees to within 2 sigma of the latest results from the Planck CMB data.},

In this approach, all mass is associated with virialized dark matter halos; models of the number and spatial distribution of the halos, and the distribution of dark matter within each halo, are used to provide estimates of how the statistical properties of large scale density and velocity fields evolve as a result of non-linear gravitational clustering. We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of non-linear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the non-linear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.}

For this purpose, we perform two multivariate analyses using the following physical void characteristics: volume, redshift, density contrast, minimum density, contrast significance and number of member galaxies of the void. The multivariate analyses are trained on a catalog of voids obtained from a random Poisson distribution of points, used as background, and a catalog of voids identified in a mock galaxy catalog, used as signal. The classifications are then applied to voids extracted from the Data Release 12 sample of Luminous Red Galaxies in the redshift range 0.45 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS BOSS DR12 CMASS). Our results show that the resulting void catalog is nearly free of contamination by Poisson noise. We also study the effect of tracer sparsity and bias on the classification efficiencies.},

With this survey we make the most precise high-redshift measurement of the cosmological mass density of neutral hydrogen, Ω\_\{H I\}. At such high redshift, important systematic uncertainties in the identification of DLAs are produced by strong intergalactic medium absorption and QSO continuum placement. These can cause spurious DLA detections, result in real DLAs being missed or bias the inferred DLA column density distribution. We correct for these effects using a combination of mock and higher resolution spectra, and show that for the GGG DLA sample the uncertainties introduced are smaller than the statistical errors on Ω\_\{H I\}. We find Ω\_\{H I\}=0.98\^\{+0.20\}\_\{-0.18\}× 10\^\{-3\} at = 4.9, assuming a 20 per cent contribution from lower column density systems below the DLA threshold. By comparing to literature measurements at lower redshifts, we show that Ω\_\{H I\} can be described by the functional form Ω\_\{H I\}(z)∝ (1+z)\^\{0.4\}. This gradual decrease from z = 5 to 0 is consistent with the bulk of H I gas being a transitory phase fuelling star formation, which is continually replenished by more highly ionized gas from the intergalactic medium and from recycled galactic winds.},

  abstract = {We develop a new formalism to study nonlinear evolution in the growth of large-scale structure, by following the dynamics of gravitational clustering as it builds up in time. This approach is conveniently represented by Feynman diagrams constructed in terms of three objects: the initial conditions (e.g. perturbation spectrum), the vertex (describing nonlinearities) and the propagator (describing linear evolution). We show that loop corrections to the linear power spectrum organize themselves into two classes of diagrams: one corresponding to mode-coupling effects, the other to a renormalization of the propagator. Resummation of the latter gives rise to a quantity that measures the memory of perturbations to initial conditions as a function of scale. As a result of this, we show that a well-defined (renormalized) perturbation theory follows, in the sense that each term in the remaining mode-coupling series dominates at some characteristic scale and is subdominant otherwise. This is unlike standard perturbation theory, where different loop corrections can become of the same magnitude in the nonlinear regime. In companion papers we compare the resummation of the propagator with numerical simulations, and apply these results to the calculation of the nonlinear power spectrum. Remarkably, the expressions in renormalized perturbation theory can be written in a way that closely resembles the halo model.},

As it is well known from the perturbation theory, ZA initial conditions have incorrect second- and higher-order growth and therefore excite long-lived transients in the evolution of the statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We also study the improvement brought by using more accurate initial conditions based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). We show that 2LPT initial conditions reduce transients significantly and thus are much more appropriate for numerical simulations devoted to precision cosmology. Using controlled numerical experiments with ZA and 2LPT initial conditions, we show that simulations started at redshift zi = 49 using the ZA underestimate the power spectrum in the non-linear regime by about 2,4 and8per cent at z = 0,1, and3, respectively, whereas the mass function of dark matter haloes is underestimated by 5 per cent at m = 1015Msolarh-1 (z = 0) and 10 per cent at m = 2 × 1014Msolarh-1 (z = 1). The clustering of haloes is also affected to the few per cent level at z = 0. These systematics effects are typically larger than statistical uncertainties in recent mass function and power spectrum fitting formulae extracted from numerical simulations. At large scales, the measured transients in higher-order correlations can be understood from first principle calculations based on perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {The recent measurement of the gravitational redshifts of galaxies in galaxy clusters by Wojtak et al. has opened a new observational window on dark matter and modified gravity. By stacking clusters this determination effectively used the line-of-sight distortion of the cross-correlation function of massive galaxies and lower mass galaxies to estimate the gravitational redshift profile of clusters out to 4 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. Here we use a halo model of clustering to predict the distortion due to gravitational redshifts of the cross-correlation function on scales from 1 to 100 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. We compare our predictions to simulations and use the simulations to make mock catalogues relevant to current and future galaxy redshift surveys. Without formulating an optimal estimator, we find that the full Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) survey should be able to detect gravitational redshifts from large-scale structure at the ̃4σ level. Upcoming redshift surveys will greatly increase the number of galaxies useable in such studies and the BigBOSS and Euclid experiments should be capable of measurements with precision at the few per cent level. As has been recently pointed out by McDonald, Kaiser and Zhao et al., other interesting effects including relativistic beaming and transverse Doppler shift can add additional asymmetric distortions to the correlation function. While these contributions are subdominant to the gravitational redshift on large scales, they represent additional opportunities to probe gravitational physics and indicate that many qualitatively new measurements should soon be possible using large redshift surveys.},

We cross-correlate the residual flux in these spectra with BOSS quasars, and detect a positive signal on scales 1̃ 15 h\^\{-1\} Mpc. We identify and remove a source of contamination not previously accounted for, due to the effects of quasar clustering on cross-fibre light. Corrected, our quasar - Ly$\alpha$ emission cross-correlation is 50 per cent lower than that seen by Croft et al. for DR10, but still significant. Because only \{̃ \}3\{\{ per cent\}\} of space is within 15 h\^\{-1\} Mpc of a quasar, the result does not fully explore the global large-scale structure of Ly$\alpha$ emission. To do this, we cross-correlate with the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We find no signal in this case.

We use cosmological simulations with gas dynamics to investigate He II absorption in the cold dark matter (CDM) theory of structure formation. We consider two Omega = 1 CDM models with different normalizations and one open universe ( Omega 0 = 0.4) CDM model. The simulations incorporate the photoionizing UV background spectrum computed by Haardt \& Madau, which is based on the output of observed quasars and reprocessing by the Ly alpha forest. The simulated gas distribution, combined with the Haardt \& Madau spectral shape, accounts for the relative observed values of tau bar H I and tau bar He II, the effective mean optical depths for H I and He II absorption. If the background intensity is as high as Haardt \& Madau predict, then matching the absolute observed values of tau bar H I and tau bar He II requires a baryon abundance larger (by factors between 1.5 and 3 for the various CDM models) than our assumed value of Omega bh2 = 0.0125. The simulations reproduce the evolution of tau bar He II over the observed redshift range, 2.2 {$<\sptilde$} z {$<\sptilde$} 3.3, if the He II photoionization rate remains roughly constant. He II absorption in the CDM simulations is produced by a diffuse, fluctuating, intergalactic medium, which also gives rise to the H I Ly alpha forest. Much of the He II opacity arises in underdense regions where the H I optical depth is very low. We compute statistical properties of the He II and H I absorption that can be used to test the CDM models and distinguish them from an alternative scenario in which the He II absorption is caused by discrete, compact clouds. The CDM scenario predicts that a substantial amount of baryonic material resides in underdense regions at high redshift. He II absorption is the only sensitive observational probe of such extremely diffuse, intergalactic gas, so it can provide a vital test of this fundamental prediction.},

We use a million spectra targeting luminous red galaxies at z \&lt; 0.8, after subtracting a best-fitting model galaxy spectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift Ly $\alpha$ surface brightness. The quasar-Ly $\alpha$ emission cross-correlation is detected on scales 1 ̃ 15 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, with shape consistent with a ΛCDM model with Ω \_m =0.30\^\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.07\}. The predicted amplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the mean Ly $\alpha$ surface brightness, \&lt;μ\textsubscript{$\alpha$}\&gt;, the amplitude of mass fluctuations and the quasar and Ly $\alpha$ emission bias factors.

For b\textsubscript{$\alpha$} = 3, this value is ̃30 times larger than previous estimates from individually detected Ly $\alpha$ emitters, but consistent with the total ρ\textsubscript{SFR} derived from dust-corrected, continuum UV galaxy surveys, if most of the Ly $\alpha$ photons from these galaxies avoid dust absorption and are reemitted after diffusing in large gas haloes. Heating of intergalactic gas by He II photoionization from quasar radiation or jets may alternatively explain the detected correlation, and cooling radiation from gas in galactic haloes may also contribute. We also detect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-Ly $\alpha$ emission cross-correlation, finding evidence at the 3.0σ level that it is radially elongated, which may be explained by radiative-transfer effects.

  abstract = {We measure the linear power spectrum of mass-density fluctuations at redshift z=2.5 from the Lyalpha forest absorption in a sample of 19 QSO spectra, using the method introduced by Croft et al. The P(k) measurement covers the range 2pi/k\textasciitilde 450-2350 km s\^-1 (2-12 comoving h\^-1 Mpc for Omega=1), limited on the upper end by uncertainty in fitting the unabsorbed QSO continuum and on the lower end by finite spectral resolution (0.8-2.3 Å FWHM) and by nonlinear dynamical effects. We examine a number of possible sources of systematic error and find none that are significant on these scales. In particular, we show that spatial variations in the UV background caused by the discreteness of the source population should have negligible effect on our P(k) measurement. We estimate statistical errors by dividing the data set into ten subsamples. The statistical uncertainty in the rms mass-fluctuation amplitude, sigma\textasciitilde [P(k)]\^1/2, is \textasciitilde 20\%, and is dominated by the finite number of spectra in the sample. We obtain consistent P(k) measurements (with larger statistical uncertainties) from the high- and low-redshift halves of the data set, and from an entirely independent sample of nine QSO spectra with mean redshift z=2.1. A power-law fit to our results yields a logarithmic slope n=-2.25+/-0.18 and an amplitude Delta\^2\_rho(k\_p)=0.57\^+0.26\_-0.18, where Delta\^2\_rho is the contribution to the density variance from a unit interval of lnk and k\_p=0.008(km s\^-1)\^-1. Direct comparison of our mass P(k) to the measured clustering of Lyman break galaxies shows that they are a highly biased population, with a bias factor b\textasciitilde 2-5. The slope of the linear P(k), never previously measured on these scales, is close to that predicted by models based on inflation and cold dark matter (CDM). The P(k) amplitude is consistent with some scale-invariant, COBE-normalized CDM models (e.g., an open model with Omega\_0=0.4) and inconsistent with others (e.g., Omega=1). Even with limited dynamic range and substantial statistical uncertainty, a measurement of P(k) that has no unknown ``bias factors'' offers many opportunities for testing theories of structure formation and constraining cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {We measure the filling factor, correlation function, and power spectrum of transmitted flux in a large sample of Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra, comprised of 30 Keck HIRES spectra and 23 Keck LRIS spectra. We infer the linear matter power spectrum P(k) from the flux power spectrum PF(k), using an improved version of the method of Croft et al. that accounts for the influence of redshift-space distortions, nonlinearity, and thermal broadening on the shape of PF(k). The evolution of the shape and amplitude of P(k) over the redshift range of the sample (z\textasciitilde 2-4) is consistent with the predictions of gravitational instability, implying that nongravitational fluctuations do not make a large contribution to structure in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. Our fiducial measurement of P(k) comes from a subset of the data with 2.3=2.72, and total path length Δz\textasciitilde 25. It has a dimensionless amplitude Δ2(kp)=0.74+0.20-0.16 at wavenumber kp=0.03 (km s-1)-1 and is well described by a power law of index ν=-2.43+/-0.06 or by a CDM-like power spectrum with shape parameter Γ'=1.3+0.7-0.5×10- 3 (km s-1)-1 at z=2.72 (all error bars 1 σ). The correspondence to present-day P(k) parameters depends on the adopted cosmology. For Ωm=0.4, ΩΛ=0.6, the best-fit shape parameter is Γ=0.16 h Mpc-1, in good agreement with measurements from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, and the best-fit normalization is σ8=0.82(Γ/0.15)-0.44. Matching the observed cluster mass function and our measured Δ2(kp) in spatially flat cosmological models requires Ωm=0.38+0.10-0.08+2.2(Γ- 0.15). Matching Δ2(kp) in COBE-normalized, flat CDM models with no tensor fluctuations requires Ωm=(0.29+/-0.04)n-2.89 h-1.965, and models that satisfy this constraint are also consistent with our measured logarithmic slope. The Ly$\alpha$ forest complements other observational probes of the linear matter power spectrum by constraining a regime of redshift and length scale not accessible by other means, and the consistency of these inferred parameters with independent estimates provides further support for a cosmological model based on inflation, cold dark matter, and vacuum energy.},

  abstract = {We present a method to recover the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations, P(k), from observations of the high-redshift Ly alpha forest. The method is motivated by the physical picture that has emerged from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations and related semianalytic models, in which typical Ly alpha forest lines arise in a diffuse, continuous, fluctuating intergalactic medium. The thermal state of this low-density gas ( delta rho / rho {$<\sptilde$} 10) is governed by simple physical processes, which lead to a tight correlation between the Ly alpha optical depth and the underlying matter density. To recover the mass power spectrum, we (1) apply a monotonic Gaussian mapping to convert the QSO spectrum to an approximate line-of-sight density field with arbitrary normalization, (2) measure the power spectrum of this continuous density field and convert it to the equivalent three-dimensional P(k), and (3) evolve cosmological simulations with this P(k) shape and a range of normalizations and choose the normalization for which the simulations reproduce the observed power spectrum of the transmitted QSO flux. Imposing the observed mean Ly alpha opacity as a constraint in step (3) makes the derived P(k) normalization insensitive to the choice of cosmological parameters, ionizing background spectrum, or reionization history. Thus, in contrast to estimates of P(k) from galaxy clustering, there are no uncertain "bias parameters" in the recovery of the mass power spectrum from the Ly alpha forest. We test the full recovery procedure on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of three different cosmological models and show that it recovers the true mass power spectrum of the models on comoving scales \textasciitilde 1-10 h-1 Mpc, the upper scale being set by the size of the simulation boxes. The procedure works well even when it is applied to noisy (S/N \textasciitilde{} 10), moderate-resolution (\textasciitilde 40 km s-1 pixels) spectra. We present an illustrative application to Songaila \& Cowie's Keck HIRES spectrum of Q1422+231; the recovered P(k) is consistent with that of an Omega = 1, h = 0.5, sigma 8(z = 0) \textasciitilde{} 0.5 cold dark matter model. The statistical uncertainty in this result is large because it is based on a single QSO, but the method can be applied to large samples of existing QSO spectra and should thereby yield the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on small and intermediate scales at redshifts z \textasciitilde{} 2-4.},

  abstract = {The angular positions of quasars are deflected by the gravitational lensing effect of foreground matter. The Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest seen in the spectra of these quasars is therefore also lensed. We propose that the signature of weak gravitational lensing of the Ly$\alpha$ forest could be measured using similar techniques that have been applied to the lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB), and which have also been proposed for application to spectral data from 21-cm radio telescopes. As with 21-cm data, the forest has the advantage of spectral information, potentially yielding many lensed `slices' at different redshifts. We perform an illustrative idealized test, generating a high-resolution angular grid of quasars (of order arcminute separation), and lensing the Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at redshifts z = 2-3 using a foreground density field. We find that standard quadratic estimators can be used to reconstruct images of the foreground mass distribution at z ˜ 1. There currently exists a wealth of Ly$\alpha$ forest data from quasar and galaxy spectral surveys, with smaller sightline separations expected in the future. Ly$\alpha$ forest lensing is sensitive to the foreground mass distribution at redshifts intermediate between CMB lensing and galaxy shear, and avoids the difficulties of shape measurement associated with the latter. With further refinement and application of mass reconstruction techniques, weak gravitational lensing of the high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest may become a useful new cosmological probe.},

  abstract = {To understand the nature of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, we need to combine constraints on the expansion rate and growth of structure. The growth rate is usually extracted from three dimensional galaxy maps by exploiting the effects of peculiar motions on galaxy clustering. However, theoretical models of the probability distribution function (PDF) of galaxy pairwise peculiar velocities are not accurate enough on small scales to reduce the error on theoretical predictions to the level required to match the precision expected for measurements from future surveys. Here, we improve the modelling of the pairwise velocity distribution by using the Skew-T PDF, which has nonzero skewness and kurtosis. Our model accurately reproduces the redshift-space multipoles (monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole) predicted by N-body simulations, above scales of about \$10\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. We illustrate how a Taylor expansion of the streaming model can reveal the contributions of the different moments to the clustering multipoles, which are independent of the shape of the velocity PDF. The Taylor expansion explains why the Gaussian streaming model works well in predicting the first two redshift-space multipoles, although the velocity PDF is non-Gaussian even on large scales. Indeed, any PDF with the correct first two moments would produce precise results for the monopole down to scales of about \$10\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$, and for the quadrupole down to about \$30\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. An accurate model for the hexadecapole needs to include higher-order moments.},

  abstract = {A goal for pathfinder intensity mapping (IM) surveys will be detecting features in the neutral hydrogen (HI) power spectrum, which serve as conclusive evidence of cosmological signals. Observing such features at the expected scales in HI IM auto-correlations, where contribution from systematics is uncertain, will provide a more convincing cosmological detection. We demonstrate how the turnover, i.e. the peak of the power spectrum at ultra-large scales, can be detected with HI IM. We find that a MeerKAT 4,000\$\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm deg\}\^2\$ survey using the UHF-band is capable of a \$3.1\textbackslash sigma\$ detection of the turnover, relative to a null model power spectrum with no turnover. This should exceed that capable from current galaxy surveys in optical and near-infrared. The detection significance falls to \$\{\textbackslash sim\}1\textbackslash sigma\$ in MeerKAT's L-band but can reach \$\{\textbackslash sim\}13\textbackslash sigma\$ with the SKAO, which should easily surpass the constraint capable from future Stage-IV-like spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We also propose a new model-independent methodology for constraining the precise turnover scale (\$k\_0\$) and our tests on UHF-band simulated data achieved a precision of 10\%. This improved to 2.4\% when using the full SKAO. We demonstrate how the results are robust to foreground contamination by using transfer functions, even when an incorrect cosmology has been assumed in their construction. Given that the turnover is related to the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality, a sufficiently precise constraint of \$k\_0\$ presents the possibility for a novel probe of cosmology. We therefore present a potential methodology for constructing a standard-ruler-based distance measurement, independent of the sound horizon, using the turnover location in the HI power spectrum.},

  abstract = {The future of precision cosmology could benefit from cross-correlations between intensity maps of unresolved neutral hydrogen (H I) and more conventional optical galaxy surveys. A major challenge that needs to be overcome is removing the 21cm foreground emission that contaminates the cosmological H I signal. Using N-body simulations, we simulate H I intensity maps and optical catalogues that share the same underlying cosmology. Adding simulated foreground contamination and using state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, we investigate the impacts that 21cm foregrounds and other systematics have on these cross-correlations. We find that the impact a Fast Independent Component Analysis 21cm foreground clean has on the cross-correlations with spectroscopic optical surveys with well-constrained redshifts is minimal. However, problems arise when photometric surveys are considered: We find that a redshift uncertainty σ\textsubscript{z} ≥ 0.04 causes significant degradation in the cross-power spectrum signal. We diagnose the main root of these problems, which relates to arbitrary amplitude changes along the line of sight in the intensity maps caused by the foreground clean and suggest solutions that should be applicable to real data. These solutions involve a reconstruction of the line-of-sight temperature means using the available overlapping optical data along with an artificial extension to the H I data through redshift to address edge effects. We then put these solutions through a further test in a mock experiment that uses a clustering-based redshift estimation technique to constrain the photometric redshifts of the optical sample. We find that with our suggested reconstruction, cross-correlations can be utilized to make an accurate prediction of the optical redshift distribution.},

Using these simulations and analytical modelling, we investigate the impact of foreground cleaning and the instrumental beam on the power spectrum multipoles as well as on the Fourier space clustering wedges. We find that both the instrumental beam and the foreground removal can produce a quadrupole (and a hexadecapole) signal, and demonstrate the importance of controlling and accurately modelling these effects for precision radio cosmology. We conclude that these effects can be modelled with reasonable accuracy using our multipole expansion technique. We also perform an MCMC analysis to showcase the effect of foreground cleaning on the estimation of the HI abundance and bias parameters. The accompanying python toolkit is available at https://github.com/IntensityTools/MultipoleExpansion, and includes an interactive suite of examples to aid new users.},

  abstract = {Taipan is a multi-object spectroscopic galaxy survey starting in 2017 that will cover 2pi steradians over the southern sky, and obtain optical spectra for about two million galaxies out to z{$<$}0.4. Taipan will use the newly-refurbished 1.2m UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the new TAIPAN instrument, which includes an innovative 'Starbugs' positioning system capable of rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres (and up to 300 with a proposed upgrade) over the 6-deg diameter focal plane, and a purpose-built spectrograph operating from 370 to 870nm with resolving power R{$>$}2000. The main scientific goals of Taipan are: (i) to measure the distance scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H\_0) to 1\% precision, and the structure growth rate of structure to 5\%; (ii) to make the most extensive map yet constructed of the mass distribution and motions in the local Universe, using peculiar velocities based on improved Fundamental Plane distances, which will enable sensitive tests of gravitational physics; and (iii) to deliver a legacy sample of low-redshift galaxies as a unique laboratory for studying galaxy evolution as a function of mass and environment. The final survey, which will be completed within 5 years, will consist of a complete magnitude-limited sample (i{$<$}17) of about 1.2x10\^6 galaxies, supplemented by an extension to higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes (i{$<$}18.1) of a luminous red galaxy sample of about 0.8x10\^6 galaxies. Observations and data processing will be carried out remotely and in a fully-automated way, using a purpose-built automated 'virtual observer' software and an automated data reduction pipeline. The Taipan survey is deliberately designed to maximise its legacy value, by complementing and enhancing current and planned surveys of the southern sky at wavelengths from the optical to the radio.},

We propose a simple fitting function for the mass function valid across the entire range of our simulations. We find pronounced effects of nongaussianity on the clustering of dark matter halos, leading to strongly scale-dependent bias. This suggests that the large-scale clustering of rare objects may provide a sensitive probe of primordial nongaussianity.

Our sample consists of 17 bright quasars in the redshift range 2.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 4.1. Analysing the spectra with the flux transmission technique, we detect the proximity effect in the sample at high significance. We use this to estimate the average intensity of the metagalactic UV background, assuming it to be constant over this redshift range. We obtain a value of J = (9 ± 4)×10-22 erg cm-2 s-1 Hz-1 sr-1, in good agreement with previous measurements at similar z. We then apply the same procedure to individual lines of sight, finding a significant deficit in the effective optical depth close to the emission redshift in every single object except one (which by a different line of evidence does nevertheless show a noticeable proximity effect). Thus, we clearly see the proximity effect as a universal phenomenon associated with individual quasars. Using extensive Monte-Carlo simulations to quantify the error budget, we assess the expected statistical scatter in the strength of the proximity effect due to shot noise (cosmic variance). The observed scatter is larger than the predicted one, so that additional sources of scatter are required. We rule out a dispersion of spectral slopes as a significant contributor. Possible effects are long time-scale variability of the quasars and/or gravitational clustering of Ly$\alpha$ forest lines. We speculate on the possibility of using the proximity effect as a tool to constrain individual quasar ages, finding that ages between \textasciitilde 106 and \textasciitilde 108 yrs might produce a characteristic signature in the optical depth profile towards the QSO. We identify one possible candidate for this effect in our sample. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (Programme 070.A-0425).

Previous studies have attempted to explain this excess with spatial fluctuations in the ionizing background, but found that this required either extremely rare sources or problematically low values for the mean free path of ionizing photons. Here we report that much—or potentially all—of the observed excess likely arises from residual spatial variations in temperature that are an inevitable byproduct of a patchy and extended reionization process. The amplitude of opacity fluctuations generated in this way depends on the timing and duration of reionization. If the entire excess is due to temperature variations alone, the observed fluctuation amplitude favors a late-ending but extended reionization process that was roughly half complete by z̃ 9 and that ended at z̃ 6. In this scenario, the highest opacities occur in regions that reionized earliest, since they have had the most time to cool, while the lowest opacities occur in the warmer regions that reionized most recently. This correspondence potentially opens a new observational window into patchy reionization.},

  abstract = {Redshift-space distortions (RSD) generically affect any spatially-dependent observable that is mapped using redshift information. The effect on the observed clustering of galaxies is the primary example of this. This paper is devoted to another example: the effect of RSD on the apparent peculiar motions of tracers as inferred from their positions in redshift space (i.e. the observed distance). Our theoretical study is motivated by practical considerations, mainly, the direct estimation of the velocity power spectrum, which is preferably carried out using the tracer's redshift-space position (so as to avoid uncertainties in distance measurements). We formulate the redshift-space velocity field and show that RSD enters as a higher-order effect. Physically, this effect may be interpreted as a dissipative correction to the usual perfect-fluid description of dark matter. We show that the effect on the power spectrum is a damping on relatively large, quasilinear scales (k≳0.01 h-1), as was observed, though unexplained, in N-body simulations elsewhere. This paper presents two power spectrum models for the peculiar velocity field in redshift space, both of which can be considered velocity analogues of existing clustering models. In particular, we show that the "Finger-of-God" effect, while also present in the velocity field, cannot be entirely blamed for the observed damping in simulations. Our work provides some of the missing modelling ingredients required for a density-velocity multi-tracer analysis, which has been proposed for upcoming redshift surveys.},

  abstract = {This overview paper describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4 m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion, the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterize dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large-scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper, we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the Solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Λ+cold dark matter, then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 trans-Neptunian objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z {$>$} 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},

The measured amplitude of the signal agrees with Lambda cold dark matter cosmology predictions. Since the amplitude of the convergence power spectrum scales as the square of the amplitude of the density fluctuations, the 4σ detection of the lensing signal measures the amplitude of density fluctuations to 12\%.},

  abstract = {Cosmic voids are a key component of the large-scale structure that contain a plethora of cosmological information. Typically, voids are identified from the underlying galaxy distribution, which is a biased tracer of the total matter field. Previous works have shown that 2D voids identified in weak lensing maps -- weak lensing voids -- correspond better to true underdense regions along the line of sight. In this work, we study how the properties of weak lensing voids depend on the choice of void finder, by adapting several popular void finders. We present and discuss the differences between identifying voids directly in the convergence maps, and in the distribution of weak lensing peaks. Particular effort has been made to test how these results are affected by galaxy shape noise, which is a dominant source of noise in weak lensing observations. By studying the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the tangential shear profile of each void finder, we find that voids identified directly in the convergence maps have the highest SNR but are also the ones most affected by galaxy shape noise. Troughs are least affected by noise, but also have the lowest SNR. The tunnel algorithm, which identifies voids in the distribution of weak lensing peaks, represents a good compromise between finding a large tangential shear SNR and mitigating the effect of galaxy shape noise.},

In contrast to previous works which used composite spectra with matched spectral properties or explored correlations between parameters of broad emission lines, we opted for a nonparametric predictive approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) to predict the intrinsic spectrum from the spectral properties at redder (i.e., unabsorbed) wavelengths. We decomposed a sample of 12764 spectra of z ̃ 2-2.5 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) into 10 red-side (1280 Å \&lt; λ \textsubscript{rest} \&lt; 2900 Å) and 6 blue-side (1180 Å \&lt; λ \textsubscript{rest} \&lt; 1280 Å) PCA basis spectra, and constructed a projection matrix to predict the blue-side coefficients from a fit to the red-side spectrum. We found that our method predicts the blue-side continuum with ̃6\%-12\% precision and ≲1\% bias by testing on the full training set sample. We then computed predictions for the blue-side continua of the two quasars currently known at z \&gt; 7: ULAS J1120+0641 (z = 7.09) and ULAS J1342+0928 (z = 7.54). Both of these quasars are known to exhibit extreme emission line properties, so we individually calibrated the uncertainty in the continuum predictions from similar quasars in the training set, finding comparable precision but moderately higher bias than the predictions for the training set as a whole, although they may face additional systematic uncertainties due to calibration artifacts present in near-infrared echelle spectra. We find that both z \&gt; 7 quasars, and in particular ULAS J1342+0928, show signs of damping wing-like absorption at wavelengths redward of Ly$\alpha$. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {All estimators of the two-point correlation function are based on a random catalogue, a set of points with no intrinsic clustering following the selection function of a survey. High-accuracy estimates require the use of large random catalogues, which imply a high computational cost. We propose to replace the standard random catalogues by glass-like point distributions or glass catalogues, which are characterized by a power spectrum \$P(k)\textbackslash propto k\^4\$ and exhibit significantly less power than a Poisson distribution with the same number of points on scales larger than the mean inter-particle separation. We show that these distributions can be obtained by iteratively applying the technique of Zeldovich reconstruction commonly used in studies of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We provide a modified version of the widely used Landy-Szalay estimator of the correlation function adapted to the use of glass catalogues and compare its performance with the results obtained using random samples. Our results show that glass-like samples do not add any bias with respect to the results obtained using Poisson distributions. On scales larger than the mean inter-particle separation of the glass catalogues, the modified estimator leads to a significant reduction of the variance of the Legendre multipoles \$\textbackslash xi\_\textbackslash ell(s)\$ with respect to the standard Landy-Szalay results with the same number of points. The size of the glass catalogue required to achieve a given accuracy in the correlation function is significantly smaller than when using random samples. Even considering the small additional cost of constructing the glass catalogues, their use could help to drastically reduce the computational cost of configuration-space clustering analysis of future surveys while maintaining high-accuracy requirements.},

In particular we study the corrections required to account for (1) our own motion, (2) correlations in galaxy motions, and (3) a possible local under- or overdensity. For all of these effects we present a case study showing the impact on the cosmology derived by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN Survey). Correcting supernova (SN) redshifts for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole slightly overcorrects nearby SNe that share some of our local motion. We show that while neglecting the CMB dipole would cause a shift in the derived equation of state of Δw \textasciitilde{} 0.04 (at fixed Ω m ), the additional local-motion correction is currently negligible (Δw {$<\sptilde$} 0.01). We then demonstrate a covariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiar velocities. This down-weights nearby SNe and effectively acts as a graduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. Neglecting coherent velocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of Δw \textasciitilde{} 0.02. This will therefore have to be considered carefully when future surveys aim for percent-level accuracy and we recommend our statistical approach to down-weighting peculiar velocities as a more robust option than a sharp low-redshift cut.},

We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 sigma.},

  abstract = {In the context of the new standard LambdaCDM cosmology we resolve conflicts in the literature regarding fundamental aspects of the expansion of the universe and cosmic horizons and we link these concepts to observational tests. We derive the dynamics of a non-comoving galaxy and use this to demonstrate the counter-intuitive result that objects at constant proper distance can have a non-zero redshift. Receding galaxies can be blueshifted and approaching galaxies can be redshifted, even in an empty universe for which one might expect special relativity to apply. We then test the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSL) and its extension to incorporate cosmological event horizons. In spite of the fact that cosmological horizons do not generally have well-defined thermal properties, we find that the GSL is satisfied for a wide range of models. We explore in particular the relative entropic 'worth' of black hole versus cosmological horizon area. An intriguing set of models show an apparent entropy decrease but we anticipate this apparent violation of the GSL will disappear when solutions are available for black holes embedded in arbitrary backgrounds. Recent evidence suggests a small increase in the fine structure constant (alpha =e\^2/hbar c) over cosmological time scales. This raises the question of which fundamental quantities are truly constant and which might vary. We show that black hole thermodynamics may provide a means to discriminate between alternative theories invoking varying constants, because some variations in the fundamental 'constants' could lead to a violation of the generalized second law of thermodynamics.},

The first, the SFI++ sample of Tully-Fisher (TF) measurements of galaxies, provides a direct probe of the flows. The second, the whole sky distribution of galaxies in the 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) redshift survey (2MRS), yields a prediction of the flows given the cosmological density parameter, Ω, and a biasing relation between mass and galaxies. We aim at an unbiased comparison between the peculiar velocity fields extracted from the two data sets and its implication on the cosmological parameters and the biasing relation. We expand the fields in a set of orthonormal basis functions, each representing a plausible realization of a cosmological velocity field smoothed in such a way as to give a nearly constant error on the derived SFI++ velocities. The statistical analysis is done on the coefficients of the modal expansion of the fields by means of the basis functions. Our analysis completely avoids the strong error covariance in the smoothed TF velocities by the use of orthonormal basis functions and employs elaborate mock data sets to extensively calibrate the errors in 2MRS predicted velocities. We relate the 2MRS galaxy distribution to the mass density field by a linear bias factor, b, and include a luminosity-dependent, ∝L$\alpha$, galaxy weighting. We assess the agreement between the fields as a function of $\alpha$ and β=f(Ω)/b, where f is the growth factor of linear perturbations. The agreement is excellent with a reasonable χ2 per degree of freedom. For $\alpha$= 0, we derive 0.28 {$<$} β {$<$} 0.37 and 0.24 {$<$} β {$<$} 0.43, respectively, at the 68.3 per cent and 95.4 per cent confidence levels (CLs). For β= 0.33, we get $\alpha$ {$<$} 0.25 and $\alpha$ {$<$} 0.5, respectively, at the 68.3 per cent and 95.4 per cent CLs. We set a constraint on the fluctuation normalization, finding σ8= 0.66 ± 0.10, which is only 1.5σ deviant from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) results. It is remarkable that σ8 determined from this local cosmological test is close to the value derived from the cosmic microwave background, an indication of the precision of the standard model.},

  abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000 deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {$<$} 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Ly$\alpha$ forest in more than 150,000 quasar spectra (g {$<$} 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0\% at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8\% and 1.7\% at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9\% at z \textasciitilde{} 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS.},

  abstract = {In a six-year program started in 2014 July, the Extended Baryon  Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. These observations will be conducted simultaneously with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. In particular, eBOSS will measure with percent-level precision the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. eBOSS will use four different tracers of the underlying matter density field to vastly expand the volume covered by BOSS and map the large-scale-structures over the relatively unconstrained redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z = 0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA(z) to an accuracy of 1.2\% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1\% when combined with the z {$>$} 0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ∼195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of dA(z) to an accuracy of 3.1\% and H(z) to 4.7\% at an effective redshift of z = 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2, with expected precision of 2.8\% and 4.2\% on dA(z) and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 BOSS quasars, we will obtain new Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements at redshifts z {$>$} 2.1 these new data will enhance the precision of dA(z) and H(z) at z {$>$} 2.1 by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

  abstract = {The blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang has been transformed by the expansion of the Universe into the nearly isotropic 2.73K cosmic microwave background. Tiny inhomogeneities in the early Universe left their imprint on the microwave background in the form of small anisotropies in its temperature. These anisotropies contain information about basic cosmological parameters, particularly the total energy density and curvature of the Universe. Here we report the first images of resolved structure in the microwave background anisotropies over a significant part of the sky. Maps at four frequencies clearly distinguish the microwave background from foreground emission. We compute the angular power spectrum of the microwave background, and find a peak at Legendre multipole lpeak = (197 +/- 6), with an amplitude ∆T200 = (69 +/- 8)μK. This is consistent with that expected for cold dark matter models in a flat (euclidean) Universe, as favoured by standard inflationary models.},

  abstract = {The clustering properties of the Universe at large-scales are currently being probed at various redshifts through several cosmological tracers and with diverse statistical estimators. Here we use the three-point angular correlation function (3PACF) to probe the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) features in the quasars catalogue from the twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with mean redshift z = 2.225, detecting the BAO imprint with a statistical significance of 2.9\{\textbackslash sigma\}, obtained using lognormal mocks. Following a quasi model-independent approach for the 3PACF, we find the BAO transversal signature for triangles with sides \$\textbackslash theta\_1 = 1.0\^\textbackslash circ\$ and \$\textbackslash theta\_2 = 1.5\^\textbackslash circ\$ and the angle between them of \$\textbackslash alpha = 1.59 \textbackslash pm 0.17\$ rad, a value that corresponds to the angular BAO scale \$\{\textbackslash theta\}\_\{BAO\} = 1.82\^\textbackslash circ \textbackslash pm 0.21\^\textbackslash circ\$ , in excellent agreement with the value found in a recent work (\$\{\textbackslash theta\}\_\{BAO\} = 1.77\^\textbackslash circ \textbackslash pm 0.31\^\textbackslash circ\$ ) applying the 2PACF to similar data. Moreover, we performed two type of tests: one to confirm the robustness of the BAO signal in the 3PACF through random displacements in the dataset, and the other to verify the suitability of our random samples, a null test that in fact does not show any signature that could bias our results.},

To this aim, we make use of a set of simulated catalogues at z = 0.1 and 1 with different luminosity thresholds, obtained by populating dark matter haloes from a large N-body simulation using halo occupation prescriptions. We examine the most recent developments in redshift-space distortion modelling, which account for non-linearities on both small and intermediate scales produced, respectively, by randomized motions in virialized structures and non-linear coupling between the density and velocity fields. We consider the possibility of including the linear component of galaxy bias as a free parameter and directly estimate the growth rate of structure f. Results are compared to those obtained using the standard dispersion model, over different ranges of scales. We find that the model of Taruya et al., the most sophisticated one considered in this analysis, provides in general the most unbiased estimates of the growth rate of structure, with systematic errors within ±4 per cent over a wide range of galaxy populations spanning luminosities between L {$>$} L* and L {$>$} 3L*. The scale dependence of galaxy bias plays a role on recovering unbiased estimates of f when fitting quasi-non-linear scales. Its effect is particularly severe for most luminous galaxies, for which systematic effects in the modelling might be more difficult to mitigate and have to be further investigated. Finally, we also test the impact of neglecting the presence of non-negligible velocity bias with respect to mass in the galaxy catalogues. This can produce an additional systematic error of the order of 1-3 per cent depending on the redshift, comparable to the statistical errors the we aim at achieving with future high-precision surveys such as Euclid.},

We describe in this analysis the global properties of the sample and discuss the survey completeness and associated corrections.

  abstract = {We carry out a joint analysis of redshift-space distortions and  galaxy-galaxy lensing, with the aim of measuring the growth rate of structure; this is a key quantity for understanding the nature of gravity on cosmological scales and late-time cosmic acceleration. We make use of the final VIPERS redshift survey dataset, which maps a portion of the Universe at a redshift of z ≃ 0.8, and the lensing data from the CFHTLenS survey over the same area of the sky. We build a consistent theoretical model that combines non-linear galaxy biasing and redshift-space distortion models, and confront it with observations. The two probes are combined in a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis to determine the growth rate of structure at two redshifts z = 0.6 and z = 0.86. We obtain measurements of fσ8(0.6) = 0.48 ± 0.12 and fσ8(0.86) = 0.48 ± 0.10. The additional galaxy-galaxy lensing constraint alleviates galaxy bias and σ8 degeneracies, providing direct measurements of f and σ8: [f(0.6),σ8(0.6)] = [0.93 ± 0.22,0.52 ± 0.06] and [f(0.86),σ8(0.86)] = [0.99 ± 0.19,0.48 ± 0.04]. These measurements are statistically consistent with a Universe where the gravitational interactions can be described by General Relativity, although they are not yet accurate enough to rule out some commonly considered alternatives. Finally, as a complementary test we measure the gravitational slip parameter, EG, for the first time at z {$>$} 0.6. We find values of E̅G(0.6) = 0.16±0.09 and E̅G(0.86) = 0.09±0.07, when EG is averaged over scales above 3 h-1 Mpc. We find that our EG measurements exhibit slightly lower values than expected for standard relativistic gravity in a ΛCDM background, although the results are consistent within 1-2σ.

  abstract = {We report a detection of the baryon acousticoscillation (BAO) feature in the flux-correlation function of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-redshift quasars with a statistical significance of five standard deviations. The study uses 137 562 quasars in the redshift range 2.1 ≤ z ≤ 3.5 from the data release 11 (DR11) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of SDSS-III. This sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previous studies. The measured position of the BAO peak determines the angular distance, DA(z = 2.34) and expansion rate, H(z = 2.34), both on a scale set by the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd. We find DA/rd = 11.28 ± 0.65(1σ)+2.8-1.2 (2σ) and DH/rd = 9.18 ± 0.28(1σ) ± 0.6(2σ) where DH = c/H. The optimal combination, \textasciitilde DH0.7DA0.3/rd is determined with a precision of \textasciitilde 2\%. For the value rd = 147.4 Mpc, consistent with the cosmic microwave background power spectrum measured by Planck, we find DA(z = 2.34) = 1662 ± 96(1σ) Mpc and H(z = 2.34) = 222 ± 7(1σ) km s-1 Mpc-1. Tests with mock catalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematic uncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. Our results agree with the previously reported BAO measurement at the same redshift using the quasar-Ly$\alpha$ forest cross-correlation. The autocorrelation and cross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite different impact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. The combined constraints from the two correlation functions imply values of DA/rd that are 7\% lower and 7\% higher for DH/rd than the predictions of a flat ΛCDM cosmological model with the best-fit Planck parameters. With our estimated statistical errors, the significance of this discrepancy is ≈2.5σ. Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

  abstract = {We present two wide-field catalogues of photometrically selected  emission line galaxies (ELGs) at z ≈ 0.8 covering about 2800 deg2over the south galactic cap. The catalogues were obtained using a Fisher discriminant technique described in a companion paper. The two catalogues differ by the imaging used to define the Fisher discriminant: the first catalogue includes imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the second also includes information from the South Galactic Cap U-band Sky Survey. Containing respectively 560 045 and 615 601 objects, they represent the largest ELG catalogues available today and were designed for the ELG programme of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). We study potential sources of systematic variation in the angular distribution of the selected ELGs due to fluctuations of the observational parameters. We model the influence of the observational parameters using a multivariate regression and implement a weighting scheme which allows effective removal of all of the systematic errors induced by the observational parameters. We show that fluctuations in the imaging zero-points of the photometric bands have minor impact on the angular distribution of objects in our catalogues. We compute the angular clustering of both catalogues and show that our weighting procedure effectively removes spurious clustering on large scales. We fit a model to the small-scale angular clustering, showing that the selections have similar biases of 1.35/Da(z) and 1.28/Da(z). Both catalogues are publicly available.},

  abstract = {We analyse the large-scale clustering in Fourier space of emission line  galaxies (ELG) from the Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. The ELG sample contains 173 736 galaxies covering 1170 deg2 in the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.1. We perform a BAO measurement from the post-reconstruction power spectrum monopole, and study redshift space distortions (RSD) in the first three even multipoles. Photometric variations yield fluctuations of both the angular and radial survey selection functions. Those are directly inferred from data, imposing integral constraints which we model consistently. The full data set has only a weak preference for a BAO feature (1.4σ). At the effective redshift zeff = 0.845 we measure \$D\_\{\textbackslash rm V\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_\{\textbackslash rm drag\} = 18.33\_\{-0.62\}\^\{+0.57\}\$ , with DV the volume-averaged distance and rdrag the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch. In combination with the RSD measurement, at zeff = 0.85 we find \$f\textbackslash sigma \_8(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}) = 0.289\_\{-0.096\}\^\{+0.085\}\$ , with f the growth rate of structure and σ8 the normalization of the linear power spectrum, \$D\_\{\textbackslash rm H\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_\{\textbackslash rm drag\} = 20.0\_\{-2.2\}\^\{+2.4\}\$ and DM(zeff)/rdrag = 19.17 ± 0.99 with DH and DM the Hubble and comoving angular distances, respectively. These results are in agreement with those obtained in configuration space, thus allowing a consensus measurement of fσ8(zeff) = 0.315 ± 0.095, \$D\_\{\textbackslash rm H\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_\{\textbackslash rm drag\} = 19.6\_\{-2.1\}\^\{+2.2\}\$ and DM(zeff)/rdrag = 19.5 ± 1.0. This measurement is consistent with a flat ΛCDM model with Planck parameters.},

  abstract = {Clustering analyses of spectroscopic surveys are based upon density fluctuations, which are estimated by comparing the observed tracer density field to a selection function accounting for the survey density and geometry. However, this survey selection function is commonly partly inferred from the observed data itself, leading to so-called integral constraints, for which we propose a complete derivation. We discuss the normalisation of the introduced window functions, the shot noise contribution to the integral constraint corrections and wide-angle effects. Using this formalism, we review the well-known global integral constraint, arising when the expected mean galaxy density is taken to be the measured one. Another, stronger, constraint is imposed when the radial selection function itself is estimated from the data redshift distribution, as is often the case in the literature. We find that the impact of such a radial integral constraint can be as significant as the window function effect at large scales, depending on the survey geometry. Equations for this radial integral constraint are derived within our general formalism. We assess the validity of our approach by performing a Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) analysis on mock catalogues and emphasise that our results may be even more useful for analyses focusing on larger scales. Finally, as a further application, we show that unknown angular systematics can be mitigated by nulling the density fluctuations on a chosen angular scale. The induced loss of clustering is modelled by an angular integral constraint which can be combined with the radial one.},

  abstract = {Ongoing and future redshift surveys have the capability to measure the growth rate of large scale structure at the percent level over a broad range of redshifts, tightly constraining cosmological parameters. Beyond general relativity, however, the growth rate in the linear density perturbation regime can be not only redshift dependent but scale dependent, revealing important clues to modified gravity. We demonstrate that a fully model independent approach of binning the gravitational strength \$G\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}(k,z)\$ matches scalar-tensor results for the growth rate \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8(k,z)\$ to \$0.02\textbackslash\%\$-\$0.27\textbackslash\%\$ rms accuracy. For data of the quality of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) we find the bin values can be constrained to 1.4\textbackslash\%-28\textbackslash\%. We also explore the general scalar-tensor form, constraining the amplitude and past and future scalaron mass/shape parameters. Perhaps most interesting is the strong complementarity of low redshift peculiar velocity data with DESI-like redshift space distortion measurements, enabling improvements up to a factor 6-7 on 2D joint confidence contour areas. Finally, we quantify some issues with gravity parametrizations that do not include all the key physics.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present the first data set obtained with SOAR Adaptive Module-Fabry-Parot (SAM-FP), a Fabry-Perot instrument mounted inside the SOAR telescope Adaptive-Optics Module. This is the only existing imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer using laser-assisted ground-layer adaptive optics. SAM-FP was used to observe the ionized gas, traced by Halpha, in the centre of the 30 Doradus starburst (the Tarantula Nebula) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with high spatial (\textasciitilde 0.6" or 0.15 pc) and spectral (R=11200) resolution. Radial velocity, velocity dispersion and monochromatic maps were derived. The region displays a mix of narrow, sigma \textasciitilde{} 20 km/s profiles and multiple broader profiles with sigma \textasciitilde{} 70-80 km/s, indicating the complex nature of the nebula kinematics. A comparison with previously obtained VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy demonstrates that the data agree well in the regions of overlap, but the Fabry-Perot data are superior in spatial coverage. A preliminary analysis of the observations finds a new expanding bubble south of R136, with a projected radius of r=5.6 pc and an expansion velocity of 29 +/- 4 km/s. In addition, the first-time detailed kinematic maps derived here for several complexes and filaments of 30 Doradus allow identification of kinematically independent structures. These data exemplify the power of the combination of a high-order Fabry-Perot with a wide-field imager (3' x 3' GLAO-corrected field of view) for high-resolution spatial and spectral studies. In particular, SAM-FP data cubes are highly advantageous over multifibre or long-slit data sets for nebula structure studies and to search for small-scale bubbles, given their greatly improved spatial coverage. For reference, this paper also presents two appendices with detailed descriptions of the usage of Fabry-Perot devices, including formulae and explanations for understanding Fabry-Perot observations.},

In addition to 179 965 spectra with absorption in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) region, we use Ly$\alpha$ absorption in the Lyman-β region of 56 154 spectra for the first time. We measure the Hubble distance, D\textsubscript{H}, and the comoving angular diameter distance, D\textsubscript{M}, relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch r\textsubscript{d} at an effective redshift z = 2.34. Using a physical model of the correlation function outside the BAO peak, we find D\textsubscript{H}(2.34)/r\textsubscript{d} = 8.86 ± 0.29 and D\textsubscript{M}(2.34)/r\textsubscript{d} = 37.41 ± 1.86, within 1σ from the flat-ΛCDM model consistent with CMB anisotropy measurements. With the addition of polynomial "broadband" terms, the results remain within one standard deviation of the CMB-inspired model.

We also obtain a strong preference for values of the CP phase δ in the range [π,2π], excluding values close to π/2 at more than 4σ. More remarkably, our global analysis shows a hint in favor of the normal mass ordering over the inverted one at more than 3σ.

  abstract = {We present the first cosmology results from large-scale structure in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) spanning 5000 deg\$\^2\$. We perform an analysis combining three two-point correlation functions (3\$\textbackslash times\$2pt): (i) cosmic shear using 100 million source galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the cross-correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions. The analysis was designed to mitigate confirmation or observer bias; we describe specific changes made to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the results. We model the data within the flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM and \$w\$CDM cosmological models. We find consistent cosmological results between the three two-point correlation functions; their combination yields clustering amplitude \$S\_8=0.776\^\{+0.017\}\_\{-0.017\}\$ and matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.339\^\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM, mean with 68\% confidence limits; \$S\_8=0.775\^\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.024\}\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.352\^\{+0.035\}\_\{-0.041\}\$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter \$w=-0.98\^\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.20\}\$ in \$w\$CDM. This combination of DES data is consistent with the prediction of the model favored by the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy data, which is quantified with a probability-to-exceed \$p=0.13\$ to \$0.48\$. When combining DES 3\$\textbackslash times\$2pt data with available baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift-space distortion, and type Ia supernovae data, we find \$p=0.34\$. Combining all of these data sets with Planck CMB lensing yields joint parameter constraints of \$S\_8 = 0.812\^\{+0.008\}\_\{-0.008\}\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.306\^\{+0.004\}\_\{-0.005\}\$, \$h=0.680\^\{+0.004\}\_\{-0.003\}\$, and \$\textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}{$<$}0.13 \textbackslash;\textbackslash mathrm\{eV\textbackslash; (95\textbackslash\% \textbackslash;CL)\}\$ in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM; \$S\_8 = 0.812\^\{+0.008\}\_\{-0.008\}\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.302\^\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.006\}\$, \$h=0.687\^\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.007\}\$, and \$w=-1.031\^\{+0.030\}\_\{-0.027\}\$ in \$w\$CDM.

  abstract = {We present angular diameter measurements obtained by measuring the position of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in an optimised sample of galaxies from the first three years of Dark Energy Survey data (DES Y3). The sample consists of 7 million galaxies distributed over a footprint of 4100 deg\$\^2\$ with \$0.6 {$<$} z\_\{\textbackslash rm photo\} {$<$} 1.1\$ and a typical redshift uncertainty of \$0.03(1+z)\$. The sample selection is the same as in the BAO measurement with the first year of DES data, but the analysis presented here uses three times the area, extends to higher redshift and makes a number of improvements, including a fully analytical BAO template, the use of covariances from both theory and simulations, and an extensive pre-unblinding protocol. We used two different statistics: angular correlation function and power spectrum, and validate our pipeline with an ensemble of over 1500 realistic simulations. Both statistics yield compatible results. We combine the likelihoods derived from angular correlations and spherical harmonics to constrain the ratio of comoving angular diameter distance \$D\_M\$ at the effective redshift of our sample to the sound horizon scale at the drag epoch. We obtain \$D\_M(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=0.835)/r\_\{\textbackslash rm d\} = 18.92 \textbackslash pm 0.51\$, which is consistent with, but smaller than, the Planck prediction assuming flat \textbackslash lcdm, at the level of \$2.3 \textbackslash sigma\$. The analysis was performed blind and is robust to changes in a number of analysis choices. It represents the most precise BAO distance measurement from imaging data to date, and is competitive with the latest transverse ones from spectroscopic samples at \$z{$>$}0.75\$. When combined with DES 3x2pt + SNIa, they lead to improvements in \$H\_0\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$ constraints by \$\textbackslash sim 20\textbackslash\%\$},

  abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to \$z=1.0\$. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to \$z=1.7\$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (\$ 2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5\$), for the Ly-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median \$z\textbackslash approx 0.2\$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

  abstract = {This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon–CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies’ rest frame is related to clustering statistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.},

  abstract = {We calculate the redshift space correlation function and the power spectrum of density peaks of a Gaussian random field. Our derivation, which is valid on linear scales k≲0.1 hMpc−1, is based on the peak biasing relation given by Desjacques [Phys. Rev. D, 78, 103503 (2008)]. In linear theory, the redshift space power spectrum is Pspk(k,μ)=exp (−f2σ2velk2μ2)[bpk(k)+bvel(k)fμ2]2Pδ(k), where μ is the angle with respect to the line of sight, σvel is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion, f is the growth rate, and bpk(k) and bvel(k) are k-dependent linear spatial and velocity bias factors. For peaks, the value of σvel depends upon the functional form of bvel. When the k dependence is absent from the square brackets and bvel is set to unity, the resulting expression is assumed to describe models where the bias is linear and deterministic, but the velocities are unbiased. The peak model is remarkable because it has unbiased velocities in this same sense—peak motions are driven by dark matter flows—but, in order to achieve this, bvel must be k dependent. We speculate that this is true in general: k dependence of the spatial bias will lead to k dependence of bvel even if the biased tracers flow with the dark matter. Because of the k dependence of the linear bias parameters, standard manipulations applied to the peak model will lead to k-dependent estimates of the growth factor that could erroneously be interpreted as a signature of modified dark energy or gravity. We use the Fisher formalism to show that the constraint on the growth rate f is degraded by a factor of 2 if one allows for a k-dependent velocity bias of the peak type. Our analysis also demonstrates that the Gaussian smoothing term is part and parcel of linear theory. We discuss a simple estimate of nonlinear evolution and illustrate the effect of the peak bias on the redshift space multipoles. For k≲0.1 hMpc−1, the peak bias is deterministic but k dependent, so the configuration-space bias is stochastic and scale dependent, both in real and redshift space. We provide expressions for this stochasticity and its evolution.},

  abstract = {The current Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder measurement of \$H\_0\$ is reported to be in tension with the values inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), assuming standard model cosmology. However, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) reports an estimate of \$H\_0\$ in better agreement with the CMB. Hence, it is critical to reduce systematic uncertainties in local measurements to understand the origin of the Hubble tension. In this paper, we propose a uniform distance ladder, combining SNe\textasciitilde Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with a TRGB calibration of their absolute luminosity. A large, volume-limited, sample of both calibrator and Hubble flow SNe Ia from the \textbackslash emph\{same\} survey minimizes two of the largest sources of systematics: host-galaxy bias and non-uniform photometric calibration. We present results from a pilot study using existing TRGB distance to the host galaxy of ZTF SN Ia SN 2021rhu (aka ZTF21abiuvdk). Combining the ZTF calibrator with a volume-limited sample from the first data release of ZTF Hubble flow SNe Ia, we infer \$H\_0 = 76.94 \textbackslash pm 6.4\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm km\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm s\^\{-1\}\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$, an \$8.3 \textbackslash\%\$ measurement. The error budget is dominated by the single object calibrating the SN Ia luminosity in this pilot study. However, the ZTF sample includes already five other SNe Ia within \$\textbackslash sim\$ 20 Mpc for which TRGB distances can be obtained with HST. Finally, we present the prospects of building this distance ladder out to 80 Mpc with JWST observations of more than one hundred SNe Ia.},

  abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the nearby Hubble flow are excellent distance indicators in cosmology. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has observed a large sample of SNe from an untargeted, rolling survey, reaching 20.8, 20.6, and 20.3 mag in g r, and i band, respectively. With an FoV of 47 deg2, ZTF discovered {$>$} 3000 SNe Ia in a little over 2.5 yr. Here, we report on the sample of 761 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia from the first year of operations (DR1). The sample has a median redshift \$\textbackslash bar\{z\} =\$ 0.057, nearly a factor of 2 higher than the current low-z sample. Our sample has a total of 934 spectra, of which 632 were obtained with the robotic SEDm on Palomar P60. We assess the potential for precision cosmology for a total of 305 SNe with redshifts from host galaxy spectra. The sample is already comparable in size to the entire combined literature low-z anchor sample. The median first detection is 13.5 d before maximum light, about 10 d earlier than the median in the literature. Furthermore, six SNe from our sample are at DL {$<$} 80 Mpc, for which host galaxy distances can be obtained in the JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE era, such that we have calibrator and Hubble flow SNe observed with the same instrument. In the entire duration of ZTF-I, we have observed nearly 50 SNe for which we can obtain calibrator distances, key for per cent level distance scale measurements.},

The code is designed to be fast and easy to use, with a coherent, well-documented user interface. The cosmology module implements Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The LSS module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, COLOSSUS implements more than 40 different fitting functions from the literature. I discuss the core routines in detail, with particular emphasis on their accuracy.

  abstract = {Future Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys aim at observing galaxy clustering over a wide range of redshift and galaxy populations at great precision, reaching tenths of a percent, in order to detect any deviation of dark energy from the lambda cold dark matter (\{Λ CDM\}) model. We utilize a set of paired quasi-N-body FastPM simulations that were designed to mitigate the sample variance effect on the BAO feature and evaluated the BAO systematics as precisely as ̃0.01 per cent. We report anisotropic BAO scale shifts before and after density field reconstruction in the presence of redshift-space distortions over a wide range of redshift, galaxy/halo biases, and shot noise levels. We test different reconstruction schemes and different smoothing filter scales, and introduce physically motivated BAO fitting models. For the first time, we derive a Galilean-invariant infrared resummed model for halos in real and redshift space. We test these models from the perspective of robust BAO measurements and non-BAO information such as growth rate and non-linear bias. We find that pre-reconstruction BAO scale has moderate fitting-model dependence at the level of 0.1-0.2 per cent for matter while the dependence is substantially reduced to less than 0.07 per cent for halos. We find that post-reconstruction BAO shifts are generally reduced to below 0.1 per cent in the presence of galaxy/halo bias and show much smaller fitting model dependence. Different reconstruction conventions can potentially make a much larger difference on the line-of-sight BAO scale, upto 0.3 per cent. Meanwhile, the precision (error) of the BAO measurements is quite consistent regardless of the choice of the fitting model or reconstruction convention. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {The global properties of elliptical galaxies, such as luminosity, radius, projected velocity dispersion, projected luminosity, etc., form a two-dimensional family. This 'fundamental plane' of elliptical galaxies can be defined in observable terms by the velocity dispersion and mean surface brightness. Its thickness is given by the present measurement error bars, and there are no significant indications of nonlinearity or higher dimensionality. This is indicative of a strong regularity in the process of galaxy formation. The equations of the plane can be used as new, substantially improved distance indicators for elliptical galaxies. However, all morphological parameters which describe the shape of the light distribution (ellipticity, elippticity gradient, isophotal twist rate, slope of the surface brightness profile) and reflect dynamical anisotropies of stars are completely independent of this fundamental plane. Thus, the elliptical galaxies are actually a '2 + N' parameter family. The M/L ratios correlate only with the velocity dispersions and show a small intrinsic scatter, perhaps only about 30 percent, in a luminosity range spanning some four orders of magnitude; this suggests a constant fraction of the dark matter contribution in elliptical galaxies.},

Combined with spectra of 10 other quasars presented elsewhere, we have characterized the distribution of cloud properties in a way which was designed to minimize any subjective part of the analysis. We used artificial absorption spectra, with the same resolution, sampling and signal-to-noise ratio as a function of wavelength as the actual data. Distributions of the physical parameters of the Lyman alpha clouds, namely, the neutral hydrogen column density (N) and Doppler parameter (b), were approximated with dΝ/dN ∝ N-β and dΝ/db ∝ exp [-(b - )2/2σ2b], respectively. We constructed a grid of simulated spectra with different input parameters. Comparison of properties of the simulated spectra with the observed spectra yielded acceptable ranges of parameters. Our technique differs from previous similar work in that we use the information contained in the distribution of the strength of the absorption in each resolution element and the distribution of separations between absorption complexes. We derive β = 1.4±0.1 for N ranging from 1013 to 1016 cm-2 and = 30±15 km s-1. Most previous studies based on line lists indicated β = 1.7-1.9. We attribute this difference to flattening of the column density distribution for low N, recently confirmed by higher resolution observations. Our result for though consistent with values quoted in the literature, is of lower significance, since it is less than the resolution of our spectra. We conclude by commenting on the importance of line blending in data sets this kind.},

Ongoing and upcoming surveys will start to identify the underlying physics of these new phenomena, including tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy, the viability of modified gravity, the existence of extra light species, the masses of the neutrinos, and the potential of the field that drove inflation. Even after the Stage IV experiments, DESI and LSST, complete their surveys, there will still be much information left in the sky. This additional information will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark universe at an even deeper level and, in case Stage IV surveys find hints for physics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our current view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime. These ideas flow to potential projects that could start construction in the 2020's.},

The system is outlined and the results of the measurements, mostly during the first six years of the SDSS, are described. We present the reference response functions for the five color passbands derived from these measurements, and discuss column-to-column variations and variations in time, and also their effects on photometry. We also discuss the effect arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response function showing a 30\% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental sensitivity in the u band, which is calibrated out. The expected color variation is consistent with measured color variation in the catalog of repeated photometry. The color variation is Δ(u - g) \textasciitilde{} 0.01 for most stars, and at most Δ(u - g) \textasciitilde{} 0.02 mag for those with extreme colors. We verified in the final catalog that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal effects except for the secular u - g color variation for stars with extreme colors.},

  abstract = {The standard model of cosmology, lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM), is the simplest model that matches the current observations, but it relies on two hypothetical components, to wit, dark matter and dark energy. Future galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will independently shed light on these components, but a joint analysis that includes cross-correlations will be necessary to extract as much information as possible from the observations. In this paper, we carry out a multiprobe analysis based on pseudo-spectra and test it on publicly available data sets. We use CMB temperature anisotropies and CMB lensing observations from Planck as well as the spectroscopic galaxy and quasar samples of SDSS-III/BOSS, taking advantage of the large areas covered by these surveys. We build a likelihood to simultaneously analyse the auto and cross spectra of CMB lensing and tracer overdensity maps before running Markov chain Monte Carlo to assess the constraining power of the combined analysis. We then add the CMB temperature anisotropies likelihood and obtain constraints on cosmological parameters (H\textsubscript{0}, ω\textsubscript{b}, ω\textsubscript{c}, ln 10\textsuperscript{10}A\textsubscript{s}, n\textsubscript{s}, and z\textsubscript{re}) and galaxy biases. We demonstrate that the joint analysis can additionally constrain the total mass of neutrinos Σm\textsubscript{ν} as well as the dark energy equation of state w at once (for a total of eight cosmological parameters), which is impossible with either of the data sets considered separately. Finally, we discuss limitations of the analysis related to, e.g. the theoretical precision of the models, particularly in the non-linear regime. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

This measurement constitutes a position-dependent power spectrum, or a squeezed bispectrum, and quantifies the nonlinear response of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum to a large-scale overdensity. The signal is measured at 5 σ and is consistent with the expectation of the standard Λ CDM cosmological model. We measure the linear bias of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest with respect to the dark matter distribution and constrain a combination of nonlinear terms including the nonlinear bias. This new observable provides a consistency check for the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a large-scale structure probe and tests our understanding of the relation between intergalactic gas and dark matter.

In order to search for optical transients (OTs) with timescales of minutes to years, the CRTS analyses data from the Catalina Sky Survey which repeatedly covers 26,000 of square degrees on the sky. The CRTS provides a public stream of transients that are bright enough to be followed up using small telescopes. Since the beginning of the survey, all CRTS transients have been made available to astronomers around the world in real time using HTML tables,RSS feeds, and VOEvents. As part of our public outreach program, the detections are now also available in Keyhole Markup Language through Google Sky. The initial discoveries include over 350 unique OTs rising more than 2 mag from past measurements. Sixty two of these are classified as supernovae (SNe), based on light curves, prior deep imaging and spectroscopic data. Seventy seven are due to cataclysmic variables (CVs; only 13 previously known), while an additional 100 transients were too infrequently sampled to distinguish between faint CVs and SNe. The remaining OTs include active galactic nucleus, blazars, high-proper-motions stars, highly variable stars (such as UV Ceti stars), and transients of an unknown nature. Our results suggest that there is a large population of SNe missed by many current SN surveys because of selection biases. These objects appear to be associated with faint host galaxies. We also discuss the unexpected discovery of white dwarf binary systems through dramatic eclipses.},

  abstract = {The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey is a survey of 240000 emission-line galaxies in the distant Universe, measured with the AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at look-back times of 4-8Gyr. {$<$}P /{$>$}The target galaxies are selected using ultraviolet (UV) photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite, with a flux limit of NUV \&lt; 22.8mag. We also require that the targets are detected at optical wavelengths, specifically in the range 20.0 \&lt; r \&lt; 22.5mag. We use the Lyman break method applied to the UV colours, with additional optical colour limits, to select high-redshift galaxies. The galaxies generally have strong emission lines, permitting reliable redshift measurements in relatively short exposure times on the AAT. The median redshift of the galaxies is z\textsubscript{med} = 0.6. The redshift range containing 90 per cent of the galaxies is 0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.0. {$<$}P /{$>$}The survey will sample a volume of \textasciitilde 1Gpc\textsuperscript{3} over a projected area on the sky of 1000 deg\textsuperscript{2}, with an average target density of 350deg\textsuperscript{-2}. Detailed forecasts indicate that the survey will measure the BAO scale to better than 2 per cent and the tangential and radial acoustic wave scales to approximately 3 and 5 per cent, respectively. Combining the WiggleZ constraints with existing cosmic microwave background measurements and the latest supernova data, the marginalized uncertainties in the cosmological model are expected to be σ(Ω\textsubscript{m}) = 0.02 and σ(w) = 0.07 (for a constant w model). The WiggleZ measurement of w will constitute a robust, precise and independent test of dark energy models. {$<$}P /{$>$}This paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, as well as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift measurement techniques employed. It also presents an analysis of the properties of the target galaxies, including emission-line diagnostics which show that they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and Hubble Space Telescope images, which show that they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. In conjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for the first 100000 galaxies measured for the project.},

The measurement uses the complete Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) data sample: 168 889 forests and 234 367 quasars from the SDSS data release DR12. In addition to the statistical improvement on our previous study using DR11, we have implemented numerous improvements at the analysis level enabling a more accurate measurement of this cross-correlation. We have also developed the first simulations of the cross-correlation that allow us to test different aspects of our data analysis and to search for potential systematic errors in the determination of the BAO peak position. We measure the two ratios DH(z = 2.40) /rd = 9.01 ± 0.36 and DM(z = 2.40) /rd = 35.7 ± 1.7, where the errors include marginalization over the non-linear velocity of quasars and the cross-correlation of metals and quasars, among other effects. These results are within 1.8σ of the prediction of the flat-ΛCDM model describing the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We combine this study with the Ly$\alpha$-forest auto-correlation function, yielding DH(z = 2.40) /rd = 8.94 ± 0.22 and DM(z = 2.40) /rd = 36.6 ± 1.2, within 2.3σ of the same flat-ΛCDM model.},

The Mg II flux transmission continuous field at 0.3 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.6 is measured from 500,589 quasar spectra obtained in the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and the extended BOSS (eBOSS). The positions of 246,697 quasar tracers and 1346,776 galaxy tracers are extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey I and II, BOSS, and eBOSS catalogs. In addition to measuring the cosmological BAO scale and the biased matter density correlation, this study allows tests and improvements to cosmological Ly$\alpha$ analyses. A feature consistent with that of the BAOs is detected at a significance of ∆χ \textsuperscript{2} = 7.25. The measured Mg II linear transmission bias parameters are b \textsubscript{Mg II(2796)} (z = 0.59) = (-6.82 ± 0.54) × 10\textsuperscript{-4} and b \textsubscript{Mg II(2804)} (z = 0.59) = (-5.55 ± 0.46) ×10\textsuperscript{-4}, and the Mg I bias is b \textsubscript{Mg I(2853)} (z = 0.59) = (-1.48 ± 0.24) × 10\textsuperscript{-4}. Their redshift evolution is characterized by the power-law index: γ \textsubscript{Mg} = 3.36 ± 0.46. These measurements open a new window toward using BAOs from flux transmission at z \&lt; 1 in the final eBOSS sample and in the upcoming sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.},

This analysis uses observations of a 1500 deg\$\^2\$ region at 95, 150, and 220 GHz taken over a four month period in 2018. We report binned values of the \$EE\$ and \$TE\$ power spectra over the angular multipole range \$300 \textbackslash le \textbackslash ell {$<$} 3000\$, using the multifrequency data to construct six semi-independent estimates of each power spectrum and their minimum-variance combination. These measurements improve upon the previous results of SPTpol across the multipole ranges \$300 \textbackslash le \textbackslash ell \textbackslash le 1400\$ for \$EE\$ and \$300 \textbackslash le \textbackslash ell \textbackslash le 1700\$ for \$TE\$, resulting in constraints on cosmological parameters comparable to those from other current leading ground-based experiments. We find that the SPT-3G dataset is well-fit by a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmological model with parameter constraints consistent with those from Planck and SPTpol data. From SPT-3G data alone, we find \$H\_0 = 68.8 \textbackslash pm 1.5 \textbackslash mathrm\{km\textbackslash,s\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.789 \textbackslash pm 0.016\$, with a gravitational lensing amplitude consistent with the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM prediction (\$A\_L = 0.98 \textbackslash pm 0.12\$). We combine the SPT-3G and the Planck datasets and obtain joint constraints on the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. The volume of the 68\% confidence region in six-dimensional \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM parameter space is reduced by a factor of 1.5 compared to Planck-only constraints, with only slight shifts in central values. We note that the results presented here are obtained from data collected during just half of a typical observing season with only part of the focal plane operable, and that the active detector count has since nearly doubled for observations made with SPT-3G after 2018.},

We calculate mean metallicity-redshift relations and show that the metallicity dispersion arising from this environmental effect amounts to ̃0.25 dex and is an important contributor to the observed overall intrinsic scatter.},

  abstract = {In the near future, observations of the cosmic microwave background  (CMB) anisotropies will provide accurate determinations of many fundamental cosmological parameters. In this paper, we analyse degeneracies among cosmological parameters to illustrate some of the limitations inherent in CMB parameter estimation. For simplicity, throughout our analysis we assume a cold dark matter universe with power-law adiabatic scalar and tensor fluctuation spectra. We show that most of the variance in cosmological parameter estimates is contributed by a small number (two or three) of principal components. An exact likelihood analysis shows that the usual Fisher matrix approach can significantly overestimate the errors on cosmological parameters. We show that small correlated errors in estimates of the CMB power spectrum at levels well below the cosmic variance limits (caused, for example, by Galactic foregrounds or scanning errors) can lead to significant biases in cosmological parameters. Estimates of cosmological parameters can be improved very significantly by applying theoretical restrictions to the tensor component, and external constraints derived from more conventional astronomical observations such as measurements of the Hubble constant, Type 1a supernovae distances and observations of galaxy clustering and peculiar velocities.},

This has a small but non-negligible impact on the global fits using NGC 4258 as a distance scale anchor, but adds a poorly constrained source of systematic error when using the Large Magellanic Cloud as an anchor. I also show that the small Milky Way Cepheid sample with accurate parallax measurements leads to a distance to NGC 4258 that is in tension with the maser distance. I conclude that H\textsubscript{0} based on the NGC 4258 maser distance is H\textsubscript{0} = 70.6 ± 3.3 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, compatible within 1σ with the recent determination from Planck for the base six-parameter Λ cold dark matter cosmology. If the H-band period-luminosity relation is assumed to be independent of metallicity and the three distance anchors are combined, I find H\textsubscript{0} = 72.5 ± 2.5 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, which differs by 1.9σ from the Planck value. The differences between the Planck results and these estimates of H\textsubscript{0} are not large enough to provide compelling evidence for new physics at this stage.},

  abstract = {We measure the two-point clustering of spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the final sample of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) on comoving scales of 4 ≲ s ≲ 22 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. The sample covers 6950 deg\textsuperscript{2} [ ̃ 19 (h\textsuperscript{- 1}Gpc)\textsuperscript{3}] and, over the redshift range 2.2 ≤ z ≤ 2.8, contains 55 826 homogeneously selected quasars, which is twice as many as in any similar work. We deduce b\textsubscript{Q} = 3.54 ± 0.10; the most precise measurement of quasar bias to date at these redshifts. This corresponds to a host halo mass of ̃2 × 10\textsuperscript{12} h\textsuperscript{-1} M\textsubscript{☉} with an implied quasar duty cycle of ̃1 per cent. The real-space projected correlation function is well fitted by a power law of index 2 and correlation length r\textsubscript{0} = (8.12 ± 0.22) h\textsuperscript{- 1} Mpc over scales of 4 ≲ r\textsubscript{p} ≲ 25 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. To better study the evolution of quasar clustering at moderate redshift, we extend the redshift range of our study to z ̃ 3.4 and measure the bias and correlation length of three subsamples over 2.2 ≤ z ≤ 3.4. We find no significant evolution of r\textsubscript{0} or bias over this range, implying that the host halo mass of quasars decreases somewhat with increasing redshift. We find quasar clustering remains similar over a decade in luminosity, contradicting a scenario in which quasar luminosity is monotonically related to halo mass at z ≈ 2.5. Our results are broadly consistent with previous BOSS measurements, but they yield more precise constraints based upon a larger and more uniform data set.},

Following a review of the pertinent kinematics, we present alternative formulations of the Lagrangian evolution equations and establish conditions for the equivalence of the Lagrangian and Eulerian representations. We then distinguish open models based on Euclidean space \$\textbackslash R\^3\$ from closed models based (without loss of generality) on a flat torus \$\textbackslash T\^3\$. Using a simple averaging method we show that the spatially averaged variables of an inhomogeneous toroidal model form a spatially homogeneous ``background'' model and that the averages of open models, if they exist at all, in general do not obey the dynamical laws of homogeneous models. We then specialize to those inhomogeneous toroidal models whose (unique) backgrounds have a Hubble flow, and derive Lagrangian evolution equations which govern the (conformally rescaled) displacement of the inhomogeneous flow with respect to its homogeneous background. Finally, we set up an iteration scheme and prove that the resulting equations have unique solutions at any order for given initial data, while for open models there exist infinitely many different solutions for given data.},

This fully automated PDF regulated continuum fitting method models the unknown quasar continuum with a linear principal component analysis (PCA) basis, with the PCA coefficients treated as nuisance parameters. The method allows one to estimate parameters governing the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM), such as the slope of the temperature-density relation γ -1, while marginalizing out continuum uncertainties in a fully Bayesian way. Using realistic mock quasar spectra created from a simplified semi-numerical model of the IGM, we show that this method recovers the underlying quasar continua to a precision of ≃ 7 \% and ≃ 10 \% at z = 3 and z = 5, respectively. Given the number of principal component spectra, this is comparable to the underlying accuracy of the PCA model itself. Most importantly, we show that we can achieve a nearly unbiased estimate of the slope γ -1 of the IGM temperature-density relation with a precision of +/- 8.6 \% at z = 3 and +/- 6.1 \% at z = 5, for an ensemble of ten mock high-resolution quasar spectra. Applying this method to real quasar spectra and comparing to a more realistic IGM model from hydrodynamical simulations would enable precise measurements of the thermal and cosmological parameters governing the IGM, albeit with somewhat larger uncertainties, given the increased flexibility of the model.},

We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ωb/Ω0 {$>\sptilde$} Ω0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter Γ.},

For reasonable baryon fractions, this scale is imprinted on the galaxy power spectrum as a series of spectral features. Measuring these features in redshift space determines the Hubble constant, which in turn yields Ωm once combined with CMB data. Since the oscillations in both power spectra are frozen-in at recombination, this test is insensitive to low-redshift cosmology.},

The survey region covers 0.72 h\textsuperscript{-3} Gpc\textsuperscript{3} over 3816 deg\textsuperscript{2} and 0.16\&lt;z\&lt;0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z\textasciitilde 1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4\% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5\% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Ω\textsubscript{m}h\textsuperscript{2} to 8\% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Ω\textsubscript{m}=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w\textsubscript{0})+0.137Ω\textsubscript{K}. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Ω\textsubscript{K}=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

We show that the nonlinear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the nonlinearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

  abstract = {We discuss the effects of nonlinear structure formation on the signature of acoustic oscillations in the late-time galaxy distribution. We argue that the dominant nonlinear effect is the differential motion of pairs of tracers separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven by bulk flows and cluster formation and are much smaller than the acoustic scale itself. We present a model for the nonlinear evolution based on the distribution of pairwise Lagrangian displacements that provides a quantitative model for the degradation of the acoustic signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The Lagrangian displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly smaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise power spectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier basis with that in the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is more robust than the usual Fourier-space intuition would suggest, because the beat frequency between the peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small wavenumber that is well inside the linear regime. We argue that any possible shift of the acoustic scale is related to infall on a scale of 150 Mpc, which is O(0.5\%) fractionally at first order, even at z=0. For the matter, there is a first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is O(10-4). However, galaxy bias can circumvent this cancellation and produce a subpercent systematic bias.},

  abstract = {Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II), SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations. This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z {$<$} 0.7 and at z ≈ 2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that is the continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R = λ/Δλ ≈ 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain high-resolution (R ≈ 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N {$>$}= 100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51 μm {$<$} λ {$<$} 1.70 μm) spectra of 105 evolved, late-type stars, measuring separate abundances for \textasciitilde 15 elements per star and creating the first high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral diagnostics.

  abstract = {We describe the target selection and resulting properties of a  spectroscopic sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the imaging data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These galaxies are selected on the basis of color and magnitude to yield a sample of luminous intrinsically red galaxies that extends fainter and farther than the main flux-limited portion of the SDSS galaxy spectroscopic sample. The sample is designed to impose a passively evolving luminosity and rest-frame color cut to a redshift of 0.38. Additional, yet more luminous red galaxies are included to a redshift of \textasciitilde 0.5. Approximately 12 of these galaxies per square degree are targeted for spectroscopy, so the sample will number over 100,000 with the full survey. SDSS commissioning data indicate that the algorithm efficiently selects luminous (M*g\textasciitilde -21.4) red galaxies, that the spectroscopic success rate is very high, and that the resulting set of galaxies is approximately volume limited out to z=0.38. When the SDSS is complete, the LRG spectroscopic sample will fill over 1 h-3 Gpc3 with an approximately homogeneous population of galaxies and will therefore be well suited to studies of large-scale structure and clusters out to z=0.5.},

  abstract = {The discovery that neutrinos have mass has important consequences for cosmology. The main effect of massive neutrinos is to suppress the growth of cosmic structure on small scales. Such growth can be accurately modelled using cosmological \$N\$-body simulations, but doing so requires accurate initial conditions (ICs). There is a trade-off, especially with first-order ICs, between truncation errors for late starts and discreteness and relativistic errors for early starts. Errors can be minimized by starting simulations at late times using higher-order ICs. In this paper, we show that neutrino effects can be absorbed into scale-independent coefficients in higher-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). This clears the way for the use of higher-order ICs for massive neutrino simulations. We demonstrate that going to higher order substantially improves the accuracy of simulations. To match the sensitivity of surveys like DESI and Euclid, errors in the matter power spectrum should be well below 1\%. However, we find that first-order Zel'dovich ICs lead to much larger errors, even when starting as early as \$z=127\$, exceeding 1\% at \$z=0\$ for \$k{$>$}0.5\textbackslash text\{ Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for the power spectrum and \$k{$>$}0.1\textbackslash text\{ Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for the equilateral bispectrum in our simulations. Ratios of power spectra with different neutrino masses are more robust than absolute statistics, but still depend on the choice of ICs. For all statistics considered, we obtain 1\% agreement between 2LPT and 3LPT at \$z=0\$.},

  abstract = {Cosmology places the strongest current limits on the sum of neutrino masses. Future observations will further improve the sensitivity and this will require accurate cosmological simulations to quantify possible systematic uncertainties and to make predictions for non-linear scales, where much information resides. However, shot noise arising from neutrino thermal motions limits the accuracy of simulations. In this paper, we introduce a new method for simulating large-scale structure formation with neutrinos that accurately resolves the neutrinos down to small scales and significantly reduces the shot noise. The method works by tracking perturbations to the neutrino phase-space distribution with particles and reduces shot noise in the power spectrum by a factor of \$\textbackslash mathcal \{O\}\textbackslash left(10\^2\textbackslash right)\$ at z = 0 for minimal neutrino masses and significantly more at higher redshifts, without neglecting the back-reaction caused by neutrino clustering. We prove that the method is part of a family of optimal methods that minimize shot noise subject to a maximum deviation from the non-linear solution. Compared to other methods, we find per mille level agreement in the matter power spectrum and per cent level agreement in the large-scale neutrino bias, but large differences in the neutrino component on small scales. A basic version of the method can easily be implemented in existing N-body codes and allows neutrino simulations with significantly reduced particle load. Further gains are possible by constructing background models based on perturbation theory. A major advantage of this technique is that it works well for all masses, enabling a consistent exploration of the full neutrino parameter space.},

Our analysis focuses on 'protohaloes' that we identify in the simulation initial conditions with the subsets of particles belonging to individual redshift-zero haloes. We then calculate the number density and velocity divergence fields of protohaloes and estimate their autospectral densities. We also measure the corresponding cross-spectral densities with the linear matter distribution. We use our results to test a Lagrangian bias model presented by Desjacques \& Sheth which is based on the assumption that haloes form out of local density maxima of a specific height. Our comparison validates the predicted functional form for the scale dependence of the bias for both the density and the velocity fields. We also show that the bias coefficients are accurately predicted for the velocity divergence. In contrast, the theoretical values for the density bias parameters do not accurately match the numerical results as a function of halo mass. This is likely due to the simplistic assumptions that relate virialized haloes to density peaks of a given height in the model. We also detect appreciable stochasticity for the Lagrangian density bias, even on very large scales. These are not included in the model at leading order but correspond to higher order corrections.},

  abstract = {Measuring the angular clustering of galaxies as a function of redshift is a powerful method for extracting information from the three-dimensional galaxy distribution. The precision of such measurements will dramatically increase with ongoing and future wide-field galaxy surveys. However, these are also increasingly sensitive to observational and astrophysical contaminants. Here, we study the statistical properties of three methods proposed for controlling such systematics - template subtraction, basic mode projection, and extended mode projection - all of which make use of externally supplied template maps, designed to characterize and capture the spatial variations of potential systematic effects. Based on a detailed mathematical analysis, and in agreement with simulations, we find that the template subtraction method in its original formulation returns biased estimates of the galaxy angular clustering. We derive closed-form expressions that should be used to correct results for this shortcoming. Turning to the basic mode projection algorithm, we prove it to be free of any bias, whereas we conclude that results computed with extended mode projection are biased. Within a simplified setup, we derive analytical expressions for the bias and discuss the options for correcting it in more realistic configurations. Common to all three methods is an increased estimator variance induced by the cleaning process, albeit at different levels. These results enable unbiased high-precision clustering measurements in the presence of spatially varying systematics, an essential step towards realizing the full potential of current and planned galaxy surveys.},

  abstract = {This paper looks at the combined constraints from a photometric and spectroscopic survey. These surveys will measure cosmology using weak lensing (WL), galaxy clustering, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift space distortions (RSD). We find, contrary to some findings in the recent literature, that overlapping surveys can give important benefits when measuring dark energy. We therefore try to clarify the status of this issue with a full forecast of two stage-IV surveys using a new approach to properly account for covariance between the different probes in the overlapping samples. The benefit of the overlapping survey can be traced back to two factors: additional observables and sample variance cancellation. Both needs to be taken into account and contribute equally when combining 3D power spectrum and 2D correlations for lensing. With an analytic example we also illustrate that for optimal constraints, one should minimize the (Pearson) correlation coefficient between cosmological and nuisance parameters and maximize the one among nuisance parameters (e.g. galaxy bias) in the two samples. This can be achieved by increasing the overlap between the spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We show how BAO, WL and RSD contribute to this benefit and also look at some other survey designs, such as photometric redshift errors and spectroscopic density.},

  abstract = {We present a new power spectrum emulator named EuclidEmulator that  estimates the nonlinear correction to the linear dark matter power spectrum depending on the six cosmological parameters ωb, ωm, ns, h, w0, and σ8. It is constructed using the uncertainty quantification software UQLab using a spectral decomposition method called polynomial chaos expansion. All steps in its construction have been tested and optimized: the large high-resolution N-body simulations carried out with PKDGRAV3 were validated using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have converged up to wavenumbers k≈ 5 h Mpc\^\{-1\} for redshifts z ≤ 5. The emulator is based on 100 input cosmologies simulated in boxes of (1250 Mpc/h)3 using 20483 particles. We show that by creating mock emulators it is possible to successfully predict and optimize the performance of the final emulator prior to performing any N-body simulations. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is as good as one obtained with N-body simulations, conservatively, \{∼ \} 1 per cent for k≲ 1 h Mpc\^\{-1\} and z ≲ 1. This enables efficient forward modelling in the nonlinear regime, allowing for estimation of cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT, CosmicEmu, and NGenHalofit, and shown to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological observables, use higher resolution input simulations, and investigate higher dimensional cosmological parameter spaces.},

In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to improve the quality of the underlying N-body simulations used as training data: (i) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark matter species such as massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy, and the metric field, (ii) we perform the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret the results in the framework of general relativity, (iii) we run over 250 high-resolution simulations with 30003 particles in boxes of 1(h-1 Gpc)3 volumes based on paired-and-fixed initial conditions, and (iv) we provide a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a post-processing step in order to drastically reduce systematic biases on small scales due to residual resolution effects in the simulations. We find that the inclusion of the dynamical dark energy parameter wa significantly increases the complexity and expense of creating the emulator. The high fidelity of EuclidEmulator2 is tested in various comparisons against N-body simulations as well as alternative fast predictors such as HALOFIT, HMCode, and CosmicEmu.

  abstract = {The Euclid space telescope will measure the shapes and redshifts of galaxies to reconstruct the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of cosmic structures. Estimation of the expected performance of the experiment, in terms of predicted constraints on cosmological parameters, has so far relied on different methodologies and numerical implementations, developed for different observational probes and for their combination. In this paper we present validated forecasts, that combine both theoretical and observational expertise for different cosmological probes. This is presented to provide the community with reliable numerical codes and methods for Euclid cosmological forecasts. We describe in detail the methodology adopted for Fisher matrix forecasts, applied to galaxy clustering, weak lensing and their combination. We estimate the required accuracy for Euclid forecasts and outline a methodology for their development. We then compare and improve different numerical implementations, reaching uncertainties on the errors of cosmological parameters that are less than the required precision in all cases. Furthermore, we provide details on the validated implementations that can be used by the reader to validate their own codes if required. We present new cosmological forecasts for Euclid. We find that results depend on the specific cosmological model and remaining freedom in each setup, i.e. flat or non-flat spatial cosmologies, or different cuts at nonlinear scales. The validated numerical implementations can now be reliably used for any setup. We present results for an optimistic and a pessimistic choice of such settings. We demonstrate that the impact of cross-correlations is particularly relevant for models beyond a cosmological constant and may allow us to increase the dark energy Figure of Merit by at least a factor of three.},

  abstract = {Multi-messenger gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has commenced with the detection of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated electromagnetic counterparts. The almost coincident observation of both signals places an exquisite bound on the GW speed \$|c\_g/c-1|\textbackslash leq5\textbackslash cdot10\^\{-16\}\$. We use this result to probe the nature of dark energy (DE), showing that a large class of scalar-tensor theories and DE models are highly disfavored. As an example we consider the covariant Galileon, a cosmologically viable, well motivated gravity theory which predicts a variable GW speed at low redshift. Our results eliminate any late-universe application of these models, as well as their Horndeski and most of their beyond Horndeski generalizations. Three alternatives (and their combinations) emerge as the only possible scalar-tensor DE models: 1) restricting Horndeski's action to its simplest terms, 2) applying a conformal transformation which preserves the causal structure and 3) compensating the different terms that modify the GW speed (to be robust, the compensation has to be independent on the background on which GWs propagate). Our conclusions extend to any other gravity theory predicting varying \$c\_g\$ such as Einstein-Aether, Ho\textbackslash v\{r\}ava gravity, Generalized Proca, TeVeS and other MOND-like gravities.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new tool to probe the nature of dark energy (DE) and the fundamental properties of gravity. We review the different ways in which GWs can be used to test theories of gravity and cosmology, emphasizing models for late-time cosmic acceleration. Lagrangian-based gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR) are classified into those breaking fundamental assumptions, containing additional fields and massive graviton(s). In addition to Lagrangian based theories we present the effective theory of DE and the μ-Σ parametrization as general descriptions of cosmological gravity. Multi-messenger GW detections can be used to measure the cosmological expansion (standard sirens), providing an independent test of the DE equation of state and measuring the Hubble parameter. Several key tests of gravity involve the cosmological propagation of GWs, including anomalous GW speed, massive graviton excitations, Lorentz violating dispersion relation, modified GW luminosity distance and additional polarizations, which may also cause GW oscillations. We summarize present constraints and their impact on DE models, including those arising from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Upgrades of LIGO-Virgo detectors to design sensitivity and the next generation facilities such as LISA or Einstein Telescope will significantly improve these constraints in the next two decades.},

  abstract = {The cross-correlation between cosmic microwave background (CMB) gravitational lensing and large-scale structure tracers will be an important cosmological probe in the coming years. Quadratic estimators provide a simple and powerful (if suboptimal) way to reconstruct the CMB lensing potential and are widely used. For Gaussian fields, the cross-correlation of a quadratic-estimator CMB lensing reconstruction with a tracer is exactly unbiased if the power spectra are known and consistent analytic lensing mode response functions are used. However, the bispectrum induced by non-linear large-scale structure growth and post-Born lensing can introduce an additional bias term (N\textsubscript{L}\textsuperscript{(3/2)}) in the cross-correlation spectrum, similar to the N\textsubscript{L}\textsuperscript{(3/2)} bias in the auto-spectrum demonstrated in recent works. We give analytic flat-sky results for the cross-correlation bias using approximate models for the post-Born and large-scale structure cross-bispectra, and compare with N-body simulation results using ray-tracing techniques. We show that the bias can be at the 5-15\% level in all large-scale structure cross-correlations using small-scale CMB temperature lensing reconstruction, but is substantially reduced using polarization-based lensing estimators or simple foreground-projected temperature estimators. The relative magnitude of these effects is almost three times higher than in the CMB lensing auto-correlation, but is small enough that it can be modelled to sufficient precision using simple analytic models. We show that N\textsubscript{L}\textsuperscript{(3/2)} effects in cross-correlation will be detected with high significance when using data of future surveys and could affect systematic effects marginalization in cosmic shear measurements mimicking galaxy intrinsic alignment. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

The estimates are based primarily on certain sensitive blends near the Mg b triplet and also on the width of the Na D line. Nuclear values of the mass-to-light ratio (M/L(B)) are calculated using measured values of core radii and central surface brightnesses for several of the sampled galaxies, and it is found that the mean value of M/L(B) for giant ellipticals with an absolute bolometric magnitude of less than -20 is 7(H/50) in solar units. This value agrees well with the values for early-type spirals, implies that there is no large discontinuity in M/L between early-type spirals and ellipticals, and constitutes evidence against a stellar population strongly enriched in M-dwarfs. Both velocity dispersion and M/L(B) are found to be correlated with absolute magnitude for normal ellipticals, and the observed increase in M/L(B) is shown to be consistent with an increase in metal abundance with luminosity. It is concluded that ellipticals are close to being a one-parameter family with total mass as the most important independent variable.},

  abstract = {Galaxy spectra are essential to probe the spatial distribution of galaxies in our Universe. To better interpret current and future spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys, it is important to be able to simulate these data sets. We describe USPEC, a forward modeling tool to generate galaxy spectra taking into account some intrinsic galaxy properties as well as instrumental responses of a given telescope. The model for the intrinsic properties of the galaxy population, i.e., the luminosity functions, and size and spectral coefficients distributions, was developed in an earlier work for broad-band imaging surveys [1], and we now aim to test the model further using spectroscopic data. We apply USPEC to the SDSS/CMASS sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We construct selection cuts that match those used to build this LRG sample, which we then apply to data and simulations in the same way. The resulting real and simulated average spectra show a good statistical agreement overall, with residual differences likely coming from a bluer galaxy population of the simulated sample. We also do not explore the impact of non-solar element ratios in our simulations. For a quantitative comparison, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the sets of spectra. By comparing the PCs constructed from simulations and data, we find good agreement for all components. The distributions of the eigencoefficients also show an appreciable overlap. We are therefore able to properly simulate the LRG sample taking into account the SDSS/BOSS instrumental responses. The differences between the two samples can be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of the simulated galaxy population, which can be reduced by further improvements of our modeling method in the future. We discuss how these results can be useful for the forward modeling of upcoming large spectroscopic surveys. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {What are the mass and galaxy profiles of cosmic voids? In this paper we use two methods to extract voids in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 redMaGiC galaxy sample to address this question. We use either 2D slices in projection, or the 3D distribution of galaxies based on photometric redshifts to identify voids. For the mass profile, we measure the tangential shear profiles of background galaxies to infer the excess surface mass density. The signal-to-noise ratio for our lensing measurement ranges between 10.7 and 14.0 for the two void samples. We infer their 3D density profiles by fitting models based on N-body simulations and find good agreement for void radii in the range 15-85 Mpc. Comparison with their galaxy profiles then allows us to test the relation between mass and light at the 10\%-level, the most stringent test to date. We find very similar shapes for the two profiles, consistent with a linear relationship between mass and light both within and outside the void radius. We validate our analysis with the help of simulated mock catalogues and estimate the impact of photometric redshift uncertainties on the measurement. Our methodology can be used for cosmological applications, including tests of gravity with voids. This is especially promising when the lensing profiles are combined with spectroscopic measurements of void dynamics via redshift-space distortions.},

  abstract = {Gravitational instability induces a simple correlation between the  large- and small-scale fluctuations of the Ly$\alpha$ flux spectrum. However, nongravitational processes involved in structure formation and evolution will alter such a correlation. In this Letter, we explore how scatter in the temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium reduces the gravitationally induced scale-scale correlation. By examining whether or not observations of the correlation are close to that predicted by pure gravity, we put constraints on the scatter in the ρ-T relation and in turn on any physical process that would lead to scatter, e.g., strong fluctuations in the UV background or radiative transfer effects. By applying this method to high-resolution Keck spectra of Q1422+231 and HS 1946+7658, we find the predicted correlation signal induced by gravity and the diminishing of this correlation signal at small scales. This suggests extra physics affects the small-scale structure of the forest, and we can constrain the scatter in the ρ-T relation to a conservative 20\% upper limit. A crude model suggests, if there is any spatial correlation of temperature, the coherence length scale must be smaller than \textasciitilde 0.3 h-1 Mpc to be consistent with the Keck data.},

With such studies in mind, we present LyaCoLoRe: a package for producing synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey datasets for BAO analyses. LyaCoLoRe transforms initial Gaussian random field skewers into skewers of transmitted flux fraction via a number of fast approximations. In this work we explain the methods of producing mock datasets used in LyaCoLoRe, and then measure correlation functions on a suite of realisations of such data. We demonstrate that we are able to recover the correct BAO signal, as well as large-scale bias parameters similar to literature values. Finally, we briefly describe methods to add further astrophysical effects to our skewers—high column density systems and metal absorbers—which act as potential complications for BAO analyses.},

This represents an improvement over previous analyses of the Ly$\alpha$ forest from high-resolution spectra in this redshift interval of a factor of 2 in the size of the data set alone. We pay particular attention to robust error estimation and extensively test for systematic effects. We find that our estimates of the quasar continuum levels in the Ly$\alpha$ forest obtained by spline fitting are systematically biased low, with the magnitude of the bias increasing with redshift, but that this bias can be accounted for using mock spectra. The mean fractional error langle Δ C/Ctruerangle is {$<$}1\% at z = 2, 4\% at z = 3, and 12\% at z = 4. Previous measurements of τeff at zgtrsim 3 based on directly fitting the quasar continua in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, which have generally neglected this effect, are therefore likely biased low. We provide estimates of the level of absorption arising from metals in the Ly$\alpha$ forest based on both direct and statistical metal removal results in the literature, finding that this contribution is ≈6\%-9\% at z = 3 and decreases monotonically with redshift. The high precision of our measurement, attaining 3\% in redshift bins of width Δ z = 0.2 around z = 3, indicates significant departures from the best-fit power-law redshift evolution [τeff = 0.0018(1 + z)3.92, when metals are left in], particularly near z = 3.2. The observed downward departure is statistically consistent with a similar feature detected in a precision statistical measurement using SDSS spectra by Bernardi and coworkers using an independent approach.},

Using the SDSS-III BOSS CMASS sample, we study how the jackknife size and number of resamplings impact the precision of the covariance estimate on the correlation function multipoles and the error on the inferred baryon acoustic scale. We compare the measurement with the MultiDark Patchy mock galaxy catalogues, and we also validate it against a set of log-normal mocks with the same survey geometry. We build several jackknife configurations that vary in size and number of resamplings. We introduce the Hartlap factor in the covariance estimate that depends on the number of jackknife resamplings. We also find that it is useful to apply the tapering scheme to estimate the precision matrix from a limited number of resamplings. The results from CMASS and mock catalogues show that the error estimate of the baryon acoustic scale does not depend on the jackknife scale. For the shift parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$, we find an average error of 1.6\%, 2.2\% and 1.2\%, respectively from CMASS, Patchy and log-normal jackknife covariances. Despite these uncertainties fluctuate significantly due to some structural limitations of the jackknife method, our \$\textbackslash alpha\$ estimates are in reasonable agreement with published pre-reconstruction analyses. Jackknife methods will provide valuable and complementary covariance estimates for future large-scale structure surveys.},

  abstract = {When planning a survey for astronomical transients, many factors such as  cadence, filter choice, sky coverage, and depth of observations need to be balanced in order to optimize the scientific gain of the survey. Here we present a software package called simsurvey for simulating the supernova lightcurves that are expected based on a survey strategy, which can then be used to determine the potential for discoveries of each strategy in question. The code is set up in a modular fashion that allows easy modification of small details of the survey and enables the user to adapt it to any survey design and transient template that they wish to use in planning their survey. As an example of its utility, we use simsurvey to simulate the lightcurve of several types of supernovae that the recently started Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is expected to find and compare the results to the discoveries made during its early operations. We conclude that ZTF will find thousands of bright supernovae per year, of which about 10 could potentially be found with two days of explosion. Over the course of three years the survey will obtain lightcurves of about 1800 type Ia supernovae with z {$<$} 0.1 that can be used as distance indicators in cosmology if they are spectroscopically classified using additional telescopes. In a comparison to detections from the ZTF public survey, we found good agreement with the numbers of detections expected from the simulations.},

  abstract = {The low-order moments, such as the bulk flow and shear, of the large-scale peculiar velocity field are sensitive probes of the matter density fluctuations on very large scales. In practice, however, peculiar velocity surveys are usually sparse and noisy, which can lead to the aliasing of small-scale power into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. Previously, we developed an optimal ‘minimum variance’ (MV) weighting scheme, designed to overcome this problem by minimizing the difference between the measured bulk flow (BF) and that which would be measured by an ideal survey. Here we extend this MV analysis to include the shear and octupole moments, which are designed to have almost no correlations between them so that they are virtually orthogonal. We apply this MV analysis to a compilation of all major peculiar velocity surveys, consisting of 4536 measurements. Our estimate of the BF on scales of ∼100 h−1 Mpc has a magnitude of |v| = 416 ± 78 km s −1 towards Galactic l= 282°± 11° and b= 6°± 6°. This result is in disagreement with Λ cold dark matter with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5 (WMAP5) cosmological parameters at a high confidence level, but is in good agreement with our previous MV result without an orthogonality constraint, showing that the shear and octupole moments did not contaminate the previous BF measurement. The shear and octupole moments are consistent with WMAP5 power spectrum, although the measurement noise is larger for these moments than for the BF. The relatively low shear moments suggest that the sources responsible for the BF are at large distances.},

Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from, e.g., counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model with \{OMEGA\}h \textasciitilde{} 0.5. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with \{OMEGA\}h as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best-fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long-wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of 10 times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.},

However, as the first stars and black holes formed within early galactic systems, their UV and X-ray radiation induced a gradual phase transition of the intergalactic gas into the warm and ionized state we currently observe. This process is known as cosmic reionization. Understanding how the energy deposition connected with galaxy and star formation shaped the properties of the intergalactic gas is one of the primary goals of present-day cosmology. In addition, reionization back reacts on galaxy evolution, determining many of the properties of the high-redshift galaxy population that represent the current frontier of our discovery of the cosmos. In these two Lectures we provide a pedagogical overview of cosmic reionization and intergalactic medium and of some of the open questions in these fields.},

  abstract = {Cosmological observations are beginning to reach a level of precision that allows us to test some of the most fundamental assumptions in our working model of the Universe. One such assumption is that gravity is governed by the theory of general relativity. In this review, we discuss how one might go about extending general relativity and how such extensions can be described in a unified way on large scales. This allows us to describe the phenomenology of modified gravity in the growth and morphology of the large-scale structure of the Universe. On smaller scales, we explore the physics of gravitational screening and how it might manifest itself in galaxies, clusters, and, more generally, in the cosmic web. We then analyze the current constraints from large-scale structure and conclude by discussing the future prospects of the field in light of the plethora of surveys currently being planned. Key results include the following: There are a plethora of alternative theories of gravity that are restricted by fundamental physics considerations. There is now a well-established formalism for describing cosmological perturbations in the linear regime for general theories of gravity. Gravitational screening can mask modifications to general relativity on small scales but may, itself, lead to distinctive signatures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Current constraints on both linear and nonlinear scales may be affected by systematic uncertainties that limit our ability to rule out alternatives to general relativity. The next generation of cosmological surveys will dramatically improve constraints on general relativity, by up to two orders of magnitude.},

This is the first time that the evolution of dark energy at high redshifts has been measured, and the current results cannot be explained by simple generalizations of the cosmological constant. We show here that a simple phenomenological interaction in the dark sector provides a good explanation for this deviation, naturally accommodating the Hubble parameter obtained by BOSS, \$H(z=2.34)=222 \textbackslash pm 7 \textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{km\textasciitilde s\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$. By performing a global fit of the parameters with the inclusion of this new data set together with the Planck data for the interacting model, we are able to show that some interacting models have constraints for \$H(2.34)\$ and \$D\_\textbackslash mathrm\{A\}(2.34)\$ that are compatible with the ones obtained by the BOSS Collaboration, showing a better concordance than \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM. We also show that the interacting models that have a small positive coupling constant, which helps alleviate the coincidence problem, are compatible with the cosmological observations. Adding the likelihood of these new baryon acoustic oscillations data shows an improvement in the global fit, although it is not statistically significant. The coupling constant could not be fully constrained by the data sets used, but the dark energy equation of state shows a slight preference for a value different from a cosmological constant.},

  abstract = {The estimation of the B-mode angular power spectrum of polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background is a key step towards a full exploitation of the scientific potential of this probe. In the context of pseudospectrum methods the major challenge is related to a contamination of the B-mode spectrum estimate with the residual power of the much larger E-mode. This so-called E-to-B leakage is unavoidably present whenever only an incomplete sky map is available, as is the case for any realistic observation. The leakage has to be then minimized or removed and ideally in such a way that neither a bias nor extra variance is introduced. In this paper, we compare from these two perspectives three different methods proposed recently in this context [K. M. Smith, Phys. Rev. D 74, 083002 (2006); W. Zhao and D. Baskaran, Phys. Rev. D 82, 023001 (2010); J. Kim and P. Naselsky, Astron. Astrophys. 519, A104 (2010)], which we first introduce within a common algebraic framework of the so-called χ fields and then study their performance on two different experimental configurations: one corresponding to a small-scale experiment covering 1\% of the sky motivated by current ground-based or balloon-borne experiments, and another to a nearly full-sky experiment, e.g., a possible cosmic microwave background B-mode satellite mission. We find that although all these methods allow us to reduce significantly the level of the E-to-B leakage, it is the method of Smith that at the same time ensures the smallest error bars in all experimental configurations studied here, owing to the fact that it permits straightforwardly an optimization of the sky apodization of the polarization maps used for the estimation. For a satellite-like experiment, this method enables a detection of the B-mode power spectrum at large angular scales but only after appropriate binning. The method of Zhao and Baskaran is a close runner-up in the case of a nearly full-sky coverage. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We perform an extensive analysis of the Civ line in three large spectroscopic surveys of quasars. Differing approaches for fitting the Civ line can be found in the literature, and we compare the most common methods to highlight the relative systematics associated with each. We develop a line fitting procedure and apply it to the Civ line in spectra from the SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys. Our results are compared with a previous study of the Mgii line in the same sample. Civ tends to be broader than the Mgii line in spectra that have both, and the average ratio between the lines is consistent with a simplistic model for a photoionised, virialised and stratified broad-line region. There is a statistically significant correlation between the widths of the Civ and Mgii lines. However, the correlation is weak, and the scatter around a best fit is only marginally less than the full dynamic range of line widths. Motivated by previous work, we examine the dispersion in the distribution of Civ line widths. We find that the dispersion in Civ line widths is essentially independent of both redshift and luminosity. This is in stark contrast to the Mgii line, which shows a strong luminosity dependence. Finally we consider our results in terms of their implications for virial black hole mass estimation. The inconsistency between Mgii and Civ line widths in single spectra, combined with the differing behaviour of the Mgii and Civ line width distributions, indicates that there must be an inconsistency between Mgii and Civ virial mass estimators. Furthermore, the level of intrinsic dispersion in Mgii and Civ line widths contributes less dynamic range to virial mass estimates than the error associated with the estimates. The indication is that the line width term in these UV virial mass estimators may be essentially irrelevant with respect to the typical uncertainty on a mass estimate.},

To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio ≳10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 M ⊙. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.},

  abstract = {The Hubble diagram is one of the cornerstones of observational cosmology. It is usually analysed assuming that, on average, the underlying relation between magnitude and redshift matches the prediction of a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker model. However, the inhomogeneity of the Universe generically biases these observables, mainly due to peculiar velocities and gravitational lensing, in a way that depends on the notion of average used in theoretical calculations. In this article, we carefully derive the notion of average which corresponds to the observation of the Hubble diagram. We then calculate its bias at second-order in cosmological perturbations, and estimate the consequences on the inference of cosmological parameters, for various current and future surveys. We find that this bias deeply affects direct estimations of the evolution of the dark-energy equation of state. However, errors in the standard inference of cosmological parameters remain smaller than observational uncertainties, even though they reach percent level on some parameters; they reduce to sub-percent level if an optimal distance indicator is used. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We focus on DESI and generally redshift surveys (BOSS, HETDEX, eBOSS, Euclid, and WFIRST), but also include CMB (Planck) and weak gravitational lensing (DES and LSST) constraints. The goal is to present a consistent set of projections, for concrete experiments, which are otherwise scattered throughout many papers and proposals. We include neutrino mass as a free parameter in most projections, as it will inevitably be relevant — DESI and other experiments can measure the sum of neutrino masses to \textasciitilde{} 0.02 eV or better, while the minimum possible sum is \textasciitilde{} 0.06 eV. We note that constraints on Dark Energy are significantly degraded by the presence of neutrino mass uncertainty, especially when using galaxy clustering only as a probe of the BAO distance scale (because this introduces additional uncertainty in the background evolution after the CMB epoch). Using broadband galaxy power becomes relatively more powerful, and bigger gains are achieved by combining lensing survey constraints with redshift survey constraints. We do not try to be especially innovative, e.g., with complex treatments of potential systematic errors — these projections are intended as a straightforward baseline for comparison to more detailed analyses.},

We study the effect both numerically, by inserting HCD systems on mock spectra for a specific model, and analytically, in the context of two-point correlations and linear theory. We show that the presence of HCDs substantially contributes to the noise of the correlation function measurement, and systematically alters the measured redshift-space correlation function of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, increasing the value of the density bias factor and decreasing the redshift distortion parameter β\textsubscript{$\alpha$} of the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We provide simple formulae for corrections on these derived parameters, as a function of the mean effective optical depth and bias factor of the host halos of the HCDs, and discuss the conditions under which these expressions should be valid. In practice, precise corrections to the measured parameters of the Ly$\alpha$ forest correlation for the HCD effects are more complex than the simple analytical approximations we present, owing to non-linear effects of the damped wings of the HCD systems and the presence of three-point terms. However, we conclude that an accurate correction for these HCD effects can be obtained numerically and calibrated with observations of the HCD-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation. We also discuss an analogous formalism to treat and correct for the contaminating effect of metal lines overlapping the Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra.},

An efficient method to generate mock realizations of Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys is presented which generates a field over the lines of sight to the survey sources only, instead of having to generate it over the entire three-dimensional volume of the survey. The method can be calibrated to reproduce the power spectrum and one-point distribution function of the transmitted flux fraction, as well as the redshift evolution of these quantities, and is easily used for modeling any survey systematic effects. We present an example of how these mock surveys are applied to predict the measurement errors in a survey with similar parameters as the BOSS quasar survey in SDSS-III.},

The algorithm exploits the unique geometry of Ly$\alpha$ forest data to efficiently measure the cross-spectrum between lines of sight as a function of parallel wavenumber, transverse separation and redshift. We start by approximating the global covariance matrix as block-diagonal, where only pixels from the same spectrum are correlated. We then compute the eigenvectors of the derivative of the signal covariance with respect to cross-spectrum parameters, and project the inverse-covariance-weighted spectra onto them. This acts much like a radial Fourier transform over redshift windows. The resulting cross-spectrum inference is then converted into our final product, an approximation of the likelihood for the 3D power spectrum expressed as second order Taylor expansion around a fiducial model. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm and comment on possible extensions.

  abstract = {We present the first measurement of the large-scale cross-correlation of Lyman alpha forest absorption and Damped Lyman alpha systems (DLA), using the 9th Data Release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The cross-correlation is clearly detected on scales up to 40 Mpc/h and is well fitted by the linear theory prediction of the standard Cold Dark Matter model of structure formation with the expected redshift distortions, confirming its origin in the gravitational evolution of structure. The amplitude of the DLA-Lyman alpha cross-correlation depends on only one free parameter, the bias factor of the DLA systems, once the Lyman alpha forest bias factors are known from independent Lyman alpha forest correlation measurements. We measure the DLA bias factor to be b\_D = (2.17 +/- 0.20) beta\_F\^\{0.22\}, where the Lyman alpha forest redshift distortion parameter beta\_F is expected to be above unity. This bias factor implies a typical host halo mass for DLAs that is much larger than expected in present DLA models, and is reproduced if the DLA cross section scales with halo mass as M\_h\^alpha, with alpha= 1.1 +/- 0.1 for beta\_F=1. Matching the observed DLA bias factor and rate of incidence requires that atomic gas remains extended in massive halos over larger areas than predicted in present simulations of galaxy formation, with typical DLA proper sizes larger than 20 kpc in host halos of masses \textasciitilde{} 10\^12 solar masses. We infer that typical galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 2 to 3 are surrounded by systems of atomic clouds that are much more extended than the luminous parts of galaxies and contain \textasciitilde{} 10\% of the baryons in the host halo.},

In earlier work, we showed that extrapolations of the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at fixed Lyman continuum photon escape fraction (fesc) are not able to reproduce the redshift evolution of this background. Here, we employ extrapolations of the high-z LFs to describe the contribution of LBGs to the ionizing photon rate, taking into account the smoothing of the baryonic perturbations, due to the background itself (i.e. the filtering mass), as well as a possible sharp increase of fesc in dwarf galaxies. Under the hypothesis of a dominant contribution of LBGs to cosmic reionization, our results suggest that sources fainter than the current observational limits should be characterized by fesc values of the order of ˜0.1-0.3 (larger than the current estimates for bright galaxies) to account for a z ≳ 6 reionization and the measured evolution of cosmic ionizing background, at the same time. The contribution to the background from quasars turns out to be relevant at z ≲ 3. Overall, our results support the case for dedicated observations of faint galaxies in the rest-frame UV, in order to better determine their physical properties. Observed fesc values outside our proposed range bear relevant consequences on the nature of the astrophysical sources responsible for cosmic reionization and/or its build-up process.},

We find a value of Ho = 69.8 +/- 0.8 (+/-1.1\textbackslash\% stat) +/- 1.7 (+/-2.4\textbackslash\% sys) km/sec/Mpc. The TRGB method is both precise and accurate, and is parallel to, but independent of the Cepheid distance scale. Our value sits midway in the range defined by the current Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2-sigma level with that of the Planck 2018 estimate, and at the 1.7-sigma level with the SHoES measurement of Ho based on the Cepheid distance scale. The TRGB distances have been measured using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of galaxy halos. The zero point of the TRGB calibration is set with a distance modulus to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.477 +/- 0.004 (stat) +/-0.020 (sys) mag, based on measurement of 20 late-type detached eclipsing binary (DEB) stars, combined with an HST parallax calibration of a 3.6 micron Cepheid Leavitt law based on Spitzer observations. We anchor the TRGB distances to galaxies that extend our measurement into the Hubble flow using the recently completed Carnegie Supernova Project I sample containing about 100 well-observed SNeIa. There are several advantages of halo TRGB distance measurements relative to Cepheid variables: these include low halo reddening, minimal effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only a shallow (calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I-band, and no need for multiple epochs of observations or concerns of different slopes with period. In addition, the host masses of our TRGB host-galaxy sample are higher on average than the Cepheid sample, better matching the range of host-galaxy masses in the CSP distant sample, and reducing potential systematic effects in the SNeIa measurements.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) has embarked on a multi-year project to identify and measure light curves for intermediate-redshift (0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.35) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using repeated five-band (ugriz) imaging over an area of 300 sq. deg. The survey region is a stripe 2.5° wide centered on the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap that has been imaged numerous times in earlier years, enabling construction of a deep reference image for the discovery of new objects. Supernova imaging observations are being acquired between September 1 and November 30 of 2005-7. During the first two seasons, each region was imaged on average every five nights. Spectroscopic follow-up observations to determine supernova type and redshift are carried out on a large number of telescopes. In its first two three-month seasons, the survey has discovered and measured light curves for 327 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, 30 probable SNe Ia, 14 confirmed SNe Ib/c, 32 confirmed SNe II, plus a large number of photometrically identified SNe Ia, 94 of which have host-galaxy spectra taken so far. This paper provides an overview of the project and briefly describes the observations completed during the first two seasons of operation.},

  abstract = {We present an estimate of the global budget of baryons in all states, with conservative estimates of the uncertainties, based on all relevant information we have been able to marshal. Most of the baryons today are still in the form of ionized gas, which contributes a mean density uncertain by a factor of about 4. Stars and their remnants are a relatively minor component, comprising for our best-guess plasma density only about 17\% of the baryons, while populations contributing most of the blue starlight comprise less than 5\%. The formation of galaxies and of stars within them appears to be a globally inefficient process. The sum over our budget, expressed as a fraction of the critical Einstein-de Sitter density, is in the range 0.007 {$<\sptilde$} Omega B {$<\sptilde$} 0.041, with a best guess of Omega B \textasciitilde{} 0.021 (at Hubble constant 70 km s-1 Mpc-1). The central value agrees with the prediction from the theory of light element production and with measures of the density of intergalactic plasma at redshift z \textasciitilde{} 3. This apparent concordance suggests that we may be close to a complete survey of the major states of the baryons.},

  abstract = {Data analysis in cosmology requires reliable covariance matrices. Covariance matrices derived from numerical simulations often require a very large number of realizations to be accurate. When a theoretical model for the covariance matrix exists, the parameters of the model can often be fit with many fewer simulations. We establish a rigorous Bayesian method for performing such a fit, but show that using the maximum posterior point is often sufficient. We show how a model covariance matrix can be tested by examining the appropriate \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ distributions from simulations. We demonstrate our method on two examples. First, we measure the two-point correlation function of halos from a large set of \$10000\$ mock halo catalogs. We build a model covariance with \$2\$ free parameters, which we fit using our procedure. The resulting best-fit model covariance obtained from just \$100\$ simulation realizations proves to be as reliable as the numerical covariance matrix built from the full \$10000\$ set. We also test our method on a setup where the covariance matrix is large by measuring the halo bispectrum for thousands of triangles for the same set of mocks. We build a block diagonal model covariance with \$2\$ free parameters as an improvement over the diagonal Gaussian covariance. Our model covariance passes the \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ test only partially in this case, signaling that the model is insufficient even using free parameters, but significantly improves over the Gaussian one.},

  abstract = {A variety of observations now indicate that intergalactic helium was fully ionized by  --{$>$}z \textasciitilde{} 3. The most recent measurements of the high-redshift quasar luminosity function imply that these sources had produced at least \textasciitilde 2.5 ionizing photons per helium atom by that time, consistent with a picture in which the known quasar population drives He II reionization. Here we describe the distribution of ionized and neutral helium gas during this era. Because the sources were rare and bright (with the photon budget dominated by quasars with luminosities  --{$>$}L L), random fluctuations in the quasar population determined the morphology of ionized gas when the global ionized fraction i\$\&overline;\{x\}i\$ --{$>$} was small, with the typical radius  --{$>$}Rc of a He III bubble \textasciitilde 15-20 comoving Mpc. Only when i  0.5\$\&overline;\{x\}i≳ 0.5\$ --{$>$} did the large-scale clustering of the quasars drive the characteristic size of ionized regions above this value. Still later, when i  0.75\$\&overline;\{x\}i≳ 0.75\$ --{$>$}, most ionizing photons were consumed by dense, recombining systems before they reached the edge of their source's ionized surroundings, halting the bubble growth when  --{$>$}Rc \textasciitilde{} 35-40 Mpc. These phases are qualitatively similar to those in hydrogen reionization, but the rarity of the sources makes the early stochastic phase much more important. Moreover, the well-known characteristics of the  --{$>$}z = 3 intergalactic medium allow a much more robust description of the late phase in which recombinations dominate.},

These correlations, usually characterized exclusively in k space [i.e., in terms of power spectra P(k)], are a fundamental feature of all current standard cosmological models. Examining them in real space we note their characteristics to be a negative power law tail ξ(r)\textasciitilde -r-4, and a sub-Poissonian normalized variance in spheres σ2(R)\textasciitilde R-4ln R. We note in particular that this latter behavior is at the limit of the most rapid decay (\textasciitilde R-4) of this quantity possible for any stochastic distribution (continuous or discrete). This very particular characteristic is usually obscured in cosmology by the use of Gaussian spheres. In a simple classification of all SSP into three categories, we highlight with the name ``superhomogeneous'' the properties of the class to which models such as this, with P(0)=0, belong. In statistical physics language they are well described as glass-like. They have neither ``scale-invariant'' features, in the sense of critical phenomena, nor fractal properties. We illustrate their properties with some simple examples, in particular that of a ``shuffled'' lattice.},

  abstract = {Peculiar velocities introduce correlations between supernova magnitudes,  which implies that the supernova Hubble diagram residual carries information on both the matter power spectrum at the present time and its growth rate. By a combination of brute-force exact computations of likelihoods and Fisher matrix analysis, we investigate how this information, which comes from supernova data only, depends on different survey parameters such as covered area, depth, and duration. We show that, for a survey like The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and a fixed redshift depth, the same observing time provides the same cosmological information whether one observes a larger area, or a smaller area during more years. We also show that although the peculiar velocity information is peaked in the range z ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 2 ] , there is yet plenty of information in z ∈ [ 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 ] , and for very high supernova number densities there is even more information in the latter range. We conclude that, after 5 years, LSST could measure σ8 with an uncertainty of 0.17 with the current strategy, and that this could be improved to 0.09 if the supernova completeness is improved to 20\%. Moreover, we forecast results considering the extra parameter γ, and show that this creates a non-linear degeneracy with σ8 that makes the Fisher matrix analysis inadequate. Finally, we discuss the possibility of achieving competitive results with the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).},

We apply a wavelet filtering technique to 18 high-resolution quasar spectra obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph, and compare these data to synthetic spectra drawn from a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in which the IGM thermal state and cosmological parameters are varied. From the wavelet analysis we obtain estimates of the IGM thermal state that are in good agreement with other recent, independent wavelet-based measurements. We also perform a reanalysis of the same data set using the Lyman $\alpha$ forest flux probability distribution function (PDF), which has previously been used to measure the IGM temperature-density relation. This provides an important consistency test for measurements of the IGM thermal state, as it enables a direct comparison of the constraints obtained using these two different methodologies. We find the constraints obtained from wavelets and the flux PDF are formally consistent with each other, although in agreement with previous studies, the flux PDF constraints favour an isothermal or inverted IGM temperature-density relation. We also perform a joint analysis by combining our wavelet and flux PDF measurements, constraining the IGM thermal state at z = 2.1 to have a temperature at mean density of T0/[103 K] = 17.3 ± 1.9 and a power-law temperature-density relation exponent γ = 1.1 ± 0.1 (1σ).

We find a strong (signal-to-noise ratio \&gt; 6) detection of Q\textsubscript{3} on scales of 55-125 Mpc/h, with a well-defined peak around 105 Mpc/h in all ξ\textsubscript{2},ξ\textsubscript{3} and Q\textsubscript{3}, in excellent agreement with the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We use very large simulations (from a cubic box of L = 7680 Mpc/h) to assess and test the significance of our measurement. Models without the BAO peak are ruled out by the Q\textsubscript{3} data with 99 per cent confidence. This detection demonstrates the non-linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z = 1000 and the present. Our measurements show the expected shape for Q\textsubscript{3} as a function of the triangular configuration. This provides a first direct measurement of the non-linear mode-coupling coefficients of density and velocity fluctuations, which, on these large scales, are independent of cosmic time, the amplitude of fluctuations or cosmological parameters. The location of the BAO peak in the data indicates Ω\textsubscript{m} = 0.28 +/- 0.05 and Ω\textsubscript{B} = 0.079 +/- 0.025 (for h = 0.70) after marginalization over spectral index (n\textsubscript{s} = 0.8-1.2) linear b\textsubscript{1} and quadratic c\textsubscript{2} bias, which are found to be in the range: b\textsubscript{1} = 1.7-2.2 and c\textsubscript{2} = 0.75-3.55. The data allow a hierarchical contribution from primordial non-Gaussianities in the range Q\textsubscript{3} = 0.55-3.35. These constraints are independent and complementary to the ones that can be obtained using the two-point function, which are presented in a separate paper. This is the first detection of the shape of Q\textsubscript{3} on BAO scales, but our errors are shot noise dominated and the SDSS volume is still relatively small, so there is ample room for future improvement in this type of measurements.},

A ξ(σ, π) model with no radial BAO peak is disfavoured at 3.2σ, whereas a model with no magnification bias is disfavoured at 2σ. The radial data enable, for the first time, a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter H(z) as a function of redshift. This is independent of earlier BAO measurements which used the spherically averaged (monopole) correlation to constrain an integral of H(z). Using the BAO peak position as a standard ruler in the radial direction, we find H(z = 0.24) = 79.69 +/- 2.32 (+/-1.29)kms\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} for z = 0.15-0.30 and H(z = 0.43) = 86.45 +/- 3.27 (+/-1.69)kms\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} for z = 0.40-0.47. The first error is a model-independent statistical estimation and the second accounts for systematics both in the measurements and in the model. For the full sample, z = 0.15-0.47, we find H(z = 0.34) = 83.80 +/- 2.96 (+/-1.59)kms\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}.},

  abstract = {Cosmological galaxy surveys aim at mapping the largest volumes to test  models with techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), which are designed to be independent of galaxy bias. Here, we explore an alternative route to constrain cosmology: sampling more moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric and spectroscopic surveys. We consider the angular galaxy-galaxy auto-correlation in narrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weak gravitational lensing (WL) and redshift space distortions (RSD). Including the cross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraints on both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history, parametrized by γ. The additional information comes from using many narrow redshift bins and from measurement of galaxy bias with both WL and RSD, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately. We show forecasts for a joint w(z) and γ figure of merit (FoM?) using linear scales over a deep (iAB {$<$} 24) photometric survey and a brighter (iAB {$<$} 22.5) spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3 per cent) photometric redshift survey. Magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce FoM? that are of the same order of magnitude of those of RSD or BAO over the spectroscopic sample. However, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a FoM? that is up to a factor of 100 times larger. Magnification alone, without shape measurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can produce better results than using shear alone. For a spectroscopic follow-up survey strategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform this cross-correlation provides five times better FoM? than targeting the higher redshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study BAO over a 2.5 times larger volume.},

  abstract = {We present an anisotropic analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale in the twelfth and final data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We independently analyse the LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples: the LOWZ sample contains 361 762 galaxies with an effective redshift of z\textsubscript{LOWZ} = 0.32; the CMASS sample consists of 777 202 galaxies with an effective redshift of z\textsubscript{CMASS} = 0.57. We extract the BAO peak position from the monopole power-spectrum moment, $\alpha$\textsubscript{0}, and from the μ\textsuperscript{2} moment, $\alpha$\textsubscript{2}, where μ is the cosine of the angle to the line of sight. The μ\textsuperscript{2}-moment provides equivalent information to that available in the quadrupole but is simpler to analyse. After applying a reconstruction algorithm to reduce the BAO suppression by bulk motions, we measure the BAO peak position in the monopole and μ\textsuperscript{2}-moment, which are related to radial and angular shifts in scale. We report H(z\textsubscript{LOWZ})r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = (11.60 ± 0.60) × 10\textsuperscript{3} km s\textsuperscript{-1} and D\textsubscript{A}(z\textsubscript{LOWZ})/r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = 6.66 ± 0.16 with a cross-correlation coefficient of r\_\{HD\_A\}=0.41, for the LOWZ sample; and H(z\textsubscript{CMASS})r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = (14.56 ± 0.37) × 10\textsuperscript{3} km s\textsuperscript{-1} and D\textsubscript{A}(z\textsubscript{CMASS})/r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = 9.42 ± 0.13 with a cross-correlation coefficient of r\_\{HD\_A\}=0.47, for the CMASS sample. We demonstrate that our results are not affected by the fiducial cosmology assumed for the analysis. We combine these results with the measurements of the BAO peak position in the monopole and quadrupole correlation function of the same data set (Cuesta et al. 2016, companion paper) and report the consensus values: H(z\textsubscript{LOWZ})r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = (11.63 ± 0.69) × 10\textsuperscript{3} km s\textsuperscript{-1} and D\textsubscript{A}(z\textsubscript{LOWZ})/r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = 6.67 ± 0.15 with r\_\{HD\_A\}=0.35 for the LOWZ sample; H(z\textsubscript{CMASS})r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = (14.67 ± 0.42) × 10\textsuperscript{3} km s\textsuperscript{-1} and D\textsubscript{A}(z\textsubscript{CMASS})/r\textsubscript{s}(z\textsubscript{d}) = 9.47 ± 0.12 with r\_\{HD\_A\}=0.52 for the CMASS sample. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We focus on combining the pre- and post-reconstructed derived quantities at different compression levels: 1) the two-point summary statistics, the power spectrum multipoles, \$P\^\{(\textbackslash ell)\}(k)\$; 2) the compressed BAO variables, \$\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash parallel,\textbackslash perp\}\$; and 3) an hybrid approach between 1) and 2). We apply these methods to the publicly available eBOSS Luminous Red Galaxy catalogues, for both data and synthetic EZ-mocks. We find that the three approaches result in very consistent posteriors when the appropriate covariance matrix estimator is used. On average, the combination at \$P\^\{(\textbackslash ell)\}(k)\$ level retrieves \$\textbackslash lesssim10\textbackslash\%\$ tighter constraints than the other two approaches, demonstrating that the standard approach of compressing before combining is nearly optimal. After checking for potential systematics, such as, the way the matrix is built and the effect of the finite number of mock on the likelihood estimator, we conclude that combining both BAO and full shape signals for the one single data realization at the level of the summary statistics is faster and brings a moderate \$10\textbackslash\%\$ improvement, with respect to the other two studied methods. Moreover we find that this method has no additional systematics when the already existing techniques in the literature are employed.},

  abstract = {We present here bounds on neutrino masses from the combination of recent Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and galaxy clustering information from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III. We use the full shape of either the photometric angular clustering (Data Release 8) or the 3D spectroscopic clustering (Data Release 9) power spectrum in different cosmological scenarios. In the ΛCDM scenario, spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements improve significantly the existing neutrino mass bounds from Planck data. We find ∑m\textsubscript{ν}\&lt;0.39eV at 95\% confidence level for the combination of the 3D power spectrum with Planck CMB data (wi lensing included) and Wilkinson Microwave Anisoptropy Probe 9-year polarization measurements. Therefore, robust neutrino mass constraints can be obtained without the addition of the prior on the Hubble constant from Hubble Space Telescope. In extended cosmological scenarios with a dark energy fluid or with nonflat geometries, galaxy clustering measurements are essential to pin down the neutrino mass bounds, providing in the majority of cases better results than those obtained from the associated measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale only. In the presence of a freely varying (constant) dark energy equation of state, we find ∑m\textsubscript{ν}\&lt;0.49eV at 95\% confidence level for the combination of the 3D power spectrum with Planck CMB data (with lensing included) and Wilkinson Microwave Anisoptropy Probe 9-year polarization measurements. This same data combination in nonflat geometries provides the neutrino mass bound ∑m\textsubscript{ν}\&lt;0.35eV at 95\% confidence level. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {With the remarkable increase in scale and precision provided by upcoming galaxy redshift surveys, systematic errors that were previously negligible may become significant. In this paper, we explore the potential impact of low-magnitude systematic redshift offsets on measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, and the cosmological constraints recovered from such measurements. Using 500 mock galaxy redshift surveys as our baseline sample, we inject a series of systematic redshift biases (ranging from +/-0.2\% to +/-2\%), and measure the resulting shift in the recovered isotropic BAO scale. When BAO measurements are combined with CMB constraints (in both \{\textbackslash Lambda\}CDM and wCDM cosmologies), plausible systematics introduce a negligible offset on combined fits of H0 and \{\textbackslash Omega\}m, and systematics must be an order of magnitude greater than this plausible baseline to introduce a 1-\{\textbackslash sigma\} shift on such combined fits. We conclude that systematic redshift biases are very unlikely to bias constraints on parameters such as H0 provided by BAO cosmology, either now or in the near future. We also detail a theoretical model that predicts the impact of uniform redshift systematics on \{\textbackslash alpha\}, and show this model is in close alignment with the results of our mock survey analysis.},

I show that, within the accuracy of the HPM approximation, the slope of the column density distribution reflects the degree of non-linearity of the cosmic gas distribution and is a function of the rms linear density fluctuation at the characteristic filtering scale only. The amplitude of the column density distribution, expressed as the value for the ionizing intensity, is derived as a function of the cosmological parameters (to about 40 per cent accuracy). The observational data are currently consistent with the value for the ionizing intensity being constant in the redshift interval z\textasciitilde -4.},

  abstract = {We introduce an efficient and accurate alternative to full hydrodynamic  simulations, hydro-PM (HPM), for the study of the low column density Lyalpha forest (N\_HI10\^14cm\^-2). It consists of a particle mesh (PM) solver, modified to compute, in addition to the gravitational potential, an effective potential due to the gas pressure. Such an effective potential can be computed from the density field because of a tight correlation between density and pressure in the low-density limit (delta{$<\sptilde$}10), which can be calculated for any photo-re-ionization history by a method outlined by Hui \& Gnedin. Such a correlation exists, in part, because of minimal shock heating in the low-density limit. We compare carefully the density and velocity fields as well as absorption spectra, computed using HPM versus hydrodynamic simulations, and find good agreement. We show that HPM is capable of reproducing measurable quantities, such as the column density distribution, computed from full hydrodynamic simulations, to a precision comparable to that of observations. We discuss how, by virtue of its speed and accuracy, HPM can enable us to use the Lyalpha forest as a cosmological probe. We also discuss in detail the smoothing of the gas (or baryon) fluctuation relative to that of the dark matter on small scales due to finite gas pressure. First, it is shown that the conventional wisdom that the linear gas fluctuation is smoothed on the Jeans scale is incorrect for general re-ionization (or reheating) history; the correct linear filtering scale is in general smaller than the Jeans scale after reheating, but larger prior to it. Secondly, it is demonstrated that in the mildly non-linear regime, a PM solver, combined with suitable pre-filtering of the initial conditions, can be used to model the low-density IGM. However, such an approximation is shown to be less accurate than HPM, unless a non-uniform pre-filtering scheme is implemented.},

The classifier uses the expert's knowledge to find heuristic features to process the images, for instance, by performing image subtraction or by extracting sparse information such as flux time series, also known as light curves. We present a successful deep learning approach that learns directly from imaging data. Our method models explicitly the spatio-temporal patterns with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Units. We train these deep neural networks using 1.3 million real astronomical images from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey to classify the sequences into five different types of astronomical transient classes. The TAO-Net (for Transient Astronomical Objects Network) architecture outperforms the results from random forest classification on light curves by 10 percentage points as measured by the F1 score for each class; the average F1 over classes goes from \$45\textbackslash\%\$ with random forest classification to \$55\textbackslash\%\$ with TAO-Net. This achievement with TAO-Net opens the possibility to develop new deep learning architectures for early transient detection. We make available the training dataset and trained models of TAO-Net to allow for future extensions of this work.},

  abstract = {An analytical framework is presented to understand the effects of a  fluctuating intensity of the cosmic ionizing background on the correlations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission fraction measured in quasar spectra. In the absence of intensity fluctuations, the Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum should have the expected cold dark matter power spectrum with redshift distortions in the linear regime, with a bias factor bδ and a redshift distortion parameter β that depend on redshift but are independent of scale. The intensity fluctuations introduce a scale dependence in both bδ and β, but keeping their product bδβ fixed. Observations of the Ly$\alpha$ correlations and cross-correlations with radiation sources like those being done at present in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of Sloan Digital Sky Survey third generation have the potential to measure this scale dependence, which reflects the biasing properties of the sources and absorbers of the ionizing background. We also compute a second term affecting the Ly$\alpha$ spectrum, due to shot noise in the sources of radiation. This term is very large if luminous quasars are assumed to produce the ionizing background and to emit isotropically with a constant luminosity, but should be reduced by a contribution from galaxies, and by the finite lifetime and anisotropic emission of quasars.},

The predicted mean halo occupation distributions of [O II] emitters have a shape typical of that inferred for star-forming galaxies, with the contribution from central galaxies, \&lt; N \&gt; \_\{[O II] cen\}, being far from the canonical step function. The \&lt; N \&gt; \_\{[O II] cen\}\vphantom\{\} can be described as the sum of an asymmetric Gaussian for discs and a step function for spheroids, which plateau below unity. The model [O II] emitters have a clustering bias close to unity, which is below the expectations for eBOSS and DESI ELGs. At z ̃ 1, a comparison with observed g-band-selected galaxy, which is expected to be dominated by [O II] emitters, indicates that our model produces too few [O II] emitters that are satellite galaxies.

Such a velocity function is desirable for several reasons. First, it enables an objective comparison of luminosity functions obtained in different bands and for different galaxy morphologies, with a statistical correction for dust extinction. In addition, the velocity function simplifies comparison of observations with predictions from high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations. We derive velocity functions from five different data sets and find rough agreement among them, but about a factor of 2 variation in amplitude. These velocity functions are then compared with N-body simulations of a ΛCDM model (corrected for baryonic infall) in order to demonstrate both the utility and the current limitations of this approach. The number density of dark matter halos and the slope of the velocity function near v*, the circular velocity corresponding to an \textasciitilde L* spiral galaxy, are found to be comparable to those of observed galaxies. The primary sources of uncertainty in construction of Ψ(logv) from observations and N-body simulations are discussed, and explanations to account for discrepancies are suggested.},

It is well positioned in the development of time-domain astronomy, offering operations at 10\% of the scale and style of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) with a single 1-m class survey telescope. The public surveys will cover the observable northern sky every three nights in g and r filters and the visible Galactic plane every night in g and r. Alerts generated by these surveys are sent in real time to brokers. A consortium of universities that provided funding (“partnership”) are undertaking several boutique surveys. The combination of these surveys producing one million alerts per night allows for exploration of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena brighter than r ∼ 20.5 on timescales of minutes to years. We describe the primary science objectives driving ZTF, including the physics of supernovae and relativistic explosions, multi-messenger astrophysics, supernova cosmology, active galactic nuclei, and tidal disruption events, stellar variability, and solar system objects.},

These simulations produce isolated, disc-dominated galaxies with structure, stellar populations, gas content, and stellar and halo masses comparable to those of the Milky Way. For a specific choice of annihilation cross-section, they agree well with the Fermi-LAT data over the full observed angular range, \$1\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ to \$15\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$, whereas their dark-matter only counterparts, lacking any compression of the inner halo by the gravitational effects of the baryons, fail to predict emission as centrally concentrated as observed. These results provide additional support to the hypothesis that the GCE is produced by annihilating dark matter. If, however, it is produced by a different mechanism, they imply a strong upper limit on annihilation rates which can be translated into upper limits on the expected \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray flux not only from the inner Galaxy but also from any substructure, with or without stars, in the Galactic halo.},

Using the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) we aim to jointly estimate the key parameters that describe the galaxy density field and its spatial correlations in redshift space. Methods. We use the Bayesian formalism to jointly reconstruct the redshift-space galaxy density field, power spectrum, galaxy bias and galaxy luminosity function given the observations and survey selection function. The high-dimensional posterior distribution is explored using the Wiener filter within a Gibbs sampler. We validate the analysis using simulated catalogues and apply it to VIPERS data taking into consideration the inhomogeneous selection function. Results. We present joint constraints on the anisotropic power spectrum as well as the bias and number density of red and blue galaxy classes in luminosity and redshift bins as well as the measurement covariances of these quantities. We find that the inferred galaxy bias and number density parameters are strongly correlated although these are only weakly correlated with the galaxy power spectrum. The power spectrum and redshift-space distortion parameters are in agreement with previous VIPERS results with the value of the growth rate \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.38\$ with 18\% uncertainty at redshift 0.7.},

  abstract = {Type Ia Supernovae have yet again the opportunity to revolutionize the field of cosmology as the new generation of surveys are acquiring thousands of nearby SNeIa opening a new era in cosmology: the direct measurement of the growth of structure parametrized by \$fD\$. This method is based on the SNeIa peculiar velocities derived from the residual to the Hubble law as direct tracers of the full gravitational potential caused by large scale structure. With this technique, we could probe not only the properties of dark energy, but also the laws of gravity. In this paper we present the analytical framework and forecasts. We show that ZTF and LSST will be able to reach 5\textbackslash\% precision on \$fD\$ by 2027. Our analysis is not significantly sensitive to photo-typing, but known selection functions and spectroscopic redshifts are mandatory. We finally introduce an idea of a dedicated spectrograph that would get all the required information in addition to boost the efficiency to each SNeIa so that we could reach the 5\textbackslash\% precision within the first two years of LSST operation and the few percent level by the end of the survey.},

The model assumes the ΛCDM model within the linear regime and includes the fit of the galaxy distances together with the underlying density field. By forward modelling the data, the method is able to mitigate biases inherent to peculiar velocity analyses, such as the Homogeneous Malmquist bias or the lognormal distribution of peculiar velocities. The statistical uncertainty on the recovered velocity field is about 150 km s-1 depending on the location, and we study systematics coming from the selection function and calibration of distance indicators. The resulting velocity field and related density fields recover the cosmography of the Local Universe which is presented in an unprecedented volume of our Universe 10 times larger than previously reached. This methodology opens the doors to reconstruction of initial conditions for larger and more accurate constrained cosmological simulations. This work is also preparatory to larger peculiar velocity data sets coming from Wallaby, TAIPAN, or LSST.},

  abstract = {High-redshift measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale from large Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys represent the next frontier of dark energy studies. As part of this effort, efficient simulations of the BAO signature from the Ly$\alpha$ forest will be required. We construct a model for producing fast, large-volume simulations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest for this purpose. Utilizing a calibrated semi-analytic approach, we are able to run very large simulations in 1 Gpc\textsuperscript{3} volumes which fully resolve the Jeans scale in less than a day on a desktop PC using a graphics processing unit enabled version of our code. The Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra extracted from our semi-analytical simulations are in excellent agreement with those obtained from a fully hydrodynamical reference simulation. Furthermore, we find that our simulated data are in broad agreement with observational measurements of the flux probability distribution and 1D flux power spectrum. We are able to correctly recover the input BAO scale from the 3D Ly$\alpha$ flux power spectrum measured from our simulated data, and estimate that a Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey like 10\textsuperscript{4} deg\textsuperscript{2} survey with ̃15 background sources per square degree and a signal-to-noise ratio of ̃5 per pixel should achieve a measurement of the BAO scale to within ̃1.4 per cent. We also use our simulations to provide simple power-law expressions for estimating the fractional error on the BAO scale on varying the signal-to-noise ratio and the number density of background sources. The speed and flexibility of our approach is well suited for exploring parameter space and the impact of observational and astrophysical systematics on the recovery of the BAO signature from forthcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys.},

This approach enables us to achieve a dynamic range within our semi-analytic model substantially larger than currently feasible with computationally expensive, fully numerical simulations. The results agree well with existing numerical simulations, with large-scale temperature fluctuations introducing a scale-dependent increase in the spherically averaged 3D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum of up to 20-30 per cent at wavenumbers k ̃ 0.02 Mpc\textsuperscript{- 1}. Although these large-scale thermal fluctuations will not substantially impact upon the recovery of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale from existing and forthcoming dark energy spectroscopic surveys, any complete forward modelling of the broad-band term in the Ly$\alpha$ correlation function will none the less require their inclusion.},

These models cannot describe well the whole colour range populated by the CMASS galaxies at all redshifts, wherefore we modify them by multiplying the SEDs with λ-β for λ {$>$} λi for different values of λi and β. When fitting these SEDs to the colours of the CMASS sample, with a burst and dust components in superposition, we can recreate the location in colour spaces inhabited by the CMASS galaxies. From the best-fitting models, we select a small subset in a two-dimensional plane, whereto the galaxies were mapped by a self-organizing map. These models are used for the estimation of photometric redshifts with a Bayesian template fitting code. The photometric redshifts with the novel templates have a very small outlier rate of 0.22 per cent, a low bias {$<$}Δz/(1 + z){$>$} = 2.0 × 10-3, and scatter of σ68 = 0.026 in the rest frame.

  abstract = {Measurements of the redshift-space galaxy clustering have been a prolific source of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance estimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models of the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of accurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance is not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on simulated realizations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology dependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this work presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of anisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues. Considering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and projections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering wedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic clustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case of a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of this paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space covariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic halo occupation distribution galaxy catalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body simulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good agreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic catalogues in the quasi-linear regime.},

We investigate the signatures induced by the Symmetron and a Chameleon f(R) model in the peculiar velocity field using N-body simulations. By studying fifth force and halo velocity profiles, we identify three general categories of effects found in screened modified gravity models: a fully screened regime where we recover Λ cold dark matter to high precision, an unscreened regime where the fifth force is in full operation, and, a partially screened regime where screening occurs in the inner part of a halo, but the fifth force is active at larger radii. These three regimes can be pointed out very clearly by analysing the deviation in the maximum cluster velocity. Observationally, the partially screened regime is of particular interest since an uniform increase of the gravitational force - as present in the unscreened regime - is degenerate with the (dynamical) halo mass estimate, and, thus, hard to detect.},

  abstract = {We forecast the benefits induced by adding the bispectrum anisotropic signal to the standard, two- and three-point, clustering statistics analysis. In particular, we forecast cosmological parameter constraints including the bispectrum higher multipoles terms together with the galaxy power spectrum (monopole plus quadrupole) and isotropic bispectrum (monopole) data vectors. To do so, an analytical covariance matrix model is presented. This template is carefully calibrated on well-known terms of a numerical covariance matrix estimated from a set of simulated galaxy catalogues. After testing the calibration using the power spectrum and isotropic bispectrum measurements from the same set of simulations, we extend the covariance modelling to the galaxy bispectrum higher multipoles. Using this covariance matrix we proceed to perform cosmological parameter inference using a suitably generated mock data vector. Including the bispectrum mutipoles up to the hexadecapole, yields 1-D \$68\textbackslash\%\$ credible regions for the set of parameters \$(b\_1,b\_2,f,\textbackslash sigma\_8,f\_\textbackslash mathrm\{NL\},\textbackslash alpha\_\textbackslash perp, \textbackslash alpha\_\textbackslash parallel)\$ tighter by a factor of 30\$\textbackslash\%\$ on average for \$k\_\textbackslash mathrm\{max\}=0.09\textbackslash,h\$/Mpc, significantly reducing at the same time the degeneracies present in the posterior distribution.},

The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chrétien design with a 2.5 m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08 m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 Å) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

For H I mass thresholds below ̃ \{10\}\textsuperscript{9} \{M\}\textsubscript{☉ }, the inferred galaxy bias factors are systematically lower than the minimum halo bias from mass-selected halo samples. We extend the simple halo model, in which the galaxy content is only determined by halo mass, by including the halo formation time as an additional parameter. A model that puts H I-rich galaxies into halos that formed late can reproduce the clustering measurements reasonably well. We present the implications of our best-fitting model on the correlation of H I mass with halo mass and formation time, as well as the halo occupation distributions and H I mass functions for central and satellite galaxies. These results are compared with the predictions from semianalytic galaxy formation models and hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations.},

All the models are built on the same high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that the HOD model generally provides the best performance in reproducing the clustering measurements in both projected and redshift spaces. The SHAM model with the same halo-galaxy relation for central and satellite galaxies (or distinct haloes and subhaloes), when including scatters, has a best-fitting χ\textsuperscript{2}/dof around 2-3. We therefore extend the SHAM model to the subhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM) by allowing the central and satellite galaxies to have different galaxy-halo relations. We infer the corresponding halo/subhalo parameters by jointly fitting the galaxy 2PCFs and abundances and consider subhaloes selected based on three properties, the mass M\textsubscript{acc} at the time of accretion, the maximum circular velocity V\textsubscript{acc} at the time of accretion, and the peak maximum circular velocity V\textsubscript{peak} over the history of the subhaloes. The three subhalo models work well for luminous galaxy samples (with luminosity above L\textsubscript{*}). For low-luminosity samples, the V\textsubscript{acc} model stands out in reproducing the data, with the V\textsubscript{peak} model slightly worse, while the M\textsubscript{acc} model fails to fit the data. We discuss the implications of the modelling results.},

  abstract = {In fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting the ability to study galaxy clustering on all scales. We present a new method for correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statistics based on spectroscopic observations. The target galaxy sample is divided into two distinct populations according to the targeting algorithm of fiber placement, one free of fiber collisions and the other consisting of collided galaxies. The clustering statistics are a combination of the contributions from these two populations. Our method makes use of observations in tile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population, and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. The method is rooted in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full three-dimensional (3D) redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) on scales both below and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular correction methods. We discuss potential systematic effects in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our method is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the square root of) the volume probed. For a sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS galaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level of 1\% on scales \textasciitilde 0.1-30 h \textsuperscript{-1} Mpc for the 2PCFs. The systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by imperfect correction of collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5\%. Our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statistics as well, enables more accurate measurements of full 3D galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys.},

We find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger for more luminous samples. The measurements are successfully interpreted within the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework with central and satellite velocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and to model redshift-space distortion effects. In agreement with previous studies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes. Including the redshift-space 2PCFs helps tighten the HOD constraints. Moreover, we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres, with the velocity dispersion about 30 per cent that of the dark matter. Such a relative motion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find that central galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect to their host haloes. The motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples is consistent with their following that of the dark matter. For faint samples, satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloes about 85 per cent that of the dark matter. We discuss possible applications of the velocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. In the appendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurement errors, which is well described by a Gaussian-convolved double exponential distribution.},

  abstract = {Aims: We present photometric properties and distance measurements  of 252 high redshift Type Ia supernovae (0.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.1) discovered during the first three years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts. Methods: Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields. Results: A flat ΛCDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift type Ia supernovae alone gives Ω\_M = 0.211 ± 0.034(stat) ± 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of ±0.026 on Ω\_M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope (β) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.

  abstract = {We describe the construction and general features of VIPERS, the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey. This ESO Large Programme is using the Very Large Telescope with the aim of building a spectroscopic sample of \textasciitilde{} 100 000 galaxies with i\textsubscript{AB}\&lt; 22.5 and 0.5 \&lt;z\&lt; 1.5. The survey covers a total area of \textasciitilde{} 24 deg\textsuperscript{2} within the CFHTLS-Wide W1 and W4 fields. VIPERS is designed to address a broad range of problems in large-scale structure and galaxy evolution, thanks to a unique combination of volume (\textasciitilde{} 5 × 10\textsuperscript{7}h\textsuperscript{-3} Mpc\textsuperscript{3}) and sampling rate (\textasciitilde{} 40\%), comparable to state-of-the-art surveys of the local Universe, together with extensive multi-band optical and near-infrared photometry. Here we present the survey design, the selection of the source catalogue and the development of the spectroscopic observations. We discuss in detail the overall selection function that results from the combination of the different constituents of the project. This includes the masks arising from the parent photometric sample and the spectroscopic instrumental footprint, together with the weights needed to account for the sampling and the success rates of the observations. Using the catalogue of 53 608 galaxy redshifts composing the forthcoming VIPERS Public Data Release 1 (PDR-1), we provide a first assessment of the quality of the spectroscopic data. The stellar contamination is found to be only 3.2\%, endorsing the quality of the star-galaxy separation process and fully confirming the original estimates based on the VVDS data, which also indicate a galaxy incompleteness from this process of only 1.4\%. Using a set of 1215 repeated observations, we estimate an rms redshift error σ\textsubscript{z}/ (1 + z) = 4.7 × 10\textsuperscript{-4} and calibrate the internal spectral quality grading. Benefiting from the combination of size and detailed sampling of this dataset, we conclude by presenting a map showing in unprecedented detail the large-scale distribution of galaxies between 5 and 8 billion years ago. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Cerro Paranal, Chile, using the Very Large Telescope under programmes 182.A-0886 and partly 070.A-9007.

  abstract = {The integrated ultraviolet flux arising from QSOs and/or hot, massive  stars in metal-producing young galaxies is likely responsible for maintaining the intergalactic diffuse gas and the Ly$\alpha$ forest clouds in a highly ionized state. The spectrum and intensity of such UV background have generally been obtained by modeling the reprocessing due to intervening material as a pure photoelectric absorption process. However, owing to the emission from radiative recombinations within the absorbing clouds, a photoionized clumpy medium could contribute substantially to the metagalactic flux. In other words, QSO absorption- line systems are sources, not just sinks of ionizing photons. We present a detailed calculation of the propagation of AGN-like ionizing radiation through the intergalactic space. We model the ionization state of absorbing clouds, and show that the universe will be more opaque above 4 Ry than previously estimated. Singly ionized helium in Ly$\alpha$ forest clouds and Lyman-limit systems is found to be very efficient in reprocessing soft X-ray, helium-ionizing photons into ultraviolet, hydrogen-ionizing ones. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of the absorbed primary photons (emitted, e.g., by quasar sources) will be reradiated by the photoionized gas through Ly$\alpha$ line emission, two-photon continuum, and recombination continuum radiation. In the light of new data and recent studies, we also reassess the contribution of the QSOs observed in optical surveys to the UV extragalactic background, and find that the stochastic reprocessing of quasar Lyman continuum radiation by hydrogen and helium along the line of sight will significantly affect the amplitude, spectral shape, and fluctuation properties of the metagalactic flux. In a scenario in which QSOs are the primary source of ionizing photons in the universe, the integrated H I Ly$\alpha$ emission at z = 0 from photoionized Ly$\alpha$ clouds and Lyman limit systems is found to be at a level of less than 5\% of current observational limits on the far-UV extragalactic radiation flux. We show that J\_912\_ increases from \textasciitilde 10\^-23\^ ergs cm\^-2\^ s\^-1\^ Hz\^- 1\^ sr\^-1\^ at the present epoch to \textasciitilde 5 x 10\^-22\^ ergs cm\^-2\^ s\^-1\^ Hz\^-1\^ sr\^-1\^ at z = 2.5. The attenuated direct quasar emission plus recombination radiation from intergalactic gas appear to provide enough hydrogen-ionizing photons to satisfy the proximity effect at large redshift. The He II/H I ratio in the diffuse intergalactic medium and the Ly$\alpha$ clouds increases from \textasciitilde 25 at z = 0 to \textasciitilde 45 at z = 2.5, to decrease again below 30 for z {$>\sptilde$} 4.5. The spectrum of the ionizing background at high redshift is shown to have a hump at energies below 40.8 eV due to redshift-smeared He Il Ly$\alpha$ line and two-photon continuum emission. We propose that observations of low-ionization species such as O II in metal-line absorption systems may be able to test the presence of such a prominent feature in the UV background spectrum. We also note that, if the metagalactic flux is dominated by QSOs, the suggested steep decline of their ionizing emissivity beyond z \textasciitilde{} 4 should produce an increase in the observed rate of incidence of Ly$\alpha$ forest clouds at these redshifts relative to an extrapolation from the intermediate-z regime, as observed by Williger et al. (1994).},

  abstract = {We present improved synthesis models of the evolving spectrum of the  UV/X-ray diffuse background, updating and extending our previous results. Five new main components are added to our radiative transfer code CUBA: (1) the sawtooth modulation of the background intensity from resonant line absorption in the Lyman series of cosmic hydrogen and helium; (2) the X-ray emission from the obscured and unobscured quasars that gives origin to the X-ray background; (3) a piecewise parameterization of the distribution in redshift and column density of intergalactic absorbers that fits recent measurements of the mean free path of 1 ryd photons; (4) an accurate treatment of the photoionization structure of absorbers, which enters in the calculation of the helium continuum opacity and recombination emissivity; and (5) the UV emission from star-forming galaxies at all redshifts. We provide tables of the predicted H I and He II photoionization and photoheating rates for use, e.g., in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a new metallicity-dependent calibration to the UV luminosity density-star formation rate density relation. A "minimal cosmic reionization model" is also presented in which the galaxy UV emissivity traces recent determinations of the cosmic history of star formation, the luminosity-weighted escape fraction of hydrogen-ionizing radiation increases rapidly with look-back time, the clumping factor of the high-redshift intergalactic medium evolves following the results of hydrodynamic simulations, and Population III stars and miniquasars make a negligible contribution to the metagalactic flux. The model provides a good fit to the hydrogen-ionization rates inferred from flux decrement and proximity effect measurements, predicts that cosmological H II (He III) regions overlap at redshift 6.7 (2.8), and yields an optical depth to Thomson scattering, τes = 0.084 that is in agreement with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe results. Our new background intensities and spectra are sensitive to a number of poorly determined input parameters and suffer from various degeneracies. Their predictive power should be constantly tested against new observations. We are therefore making our redshift-dependent UV/X emissivities and CUBA outputs freely available for public use at http://www.ucolick.org/\textasciitilde pmadau/CUBA.},

  abstract = {Current and future surveys of large-scale cosmic structure are associated with a massive and complex datastream to study, characterize, and ultimately understand the physics behind the two major components of the ‘Dark Universe’, dark energy and dark matter. In addition, the surveys also probe primordial perturbations and carry out fundamental measurements, such as determining the sum of neutrino masses. Large-scale simulations of structure formation in the Universe play a critical role in the interpretation of the data and extraction of the physics of interest. Just as survey instruments continue to grow in size and complexity, so do the supercomputers that enable these simulations. Here we report on HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code), a recently developed and evolving cosmology N-body code framework, designed to run efficiently on diverse computing architectures and to scale to millions of cores and beyond. HACC can run on all current supercomputer architectures and supports a variety of programming models and algorithms. It has been demonstrated at scale on Cell- and GPU-accelerated systems, standard multi-core node clusters, and Blue Gene systems. HACC’s design allows for ease of portability, and at the same time, high levels of sustained performance on the fastest supercomputers available. We present a description of the design philosophy of HACC, the underlying algorithms and code structure, and outline implementation details for several specific architectures. We show selected accuracy and performance results from some of the largest high resolution cosmological simulations so far performed, including benchmarks evolving more than 3.6 trillion particles.},

We show that rather small deviations from this photoionization equilibrium temperature caused by additional heating processes will lead to an overestimate of the neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus to an underestimate of the thickness of the absorber by about two orders of magnitude. Such temperature deviations are indicated both by observations and by numerical simulations. This interpretation reconciles the discrepancy between the rather small extent of heavy-element-absorption systems parallel to the line of sight obtained from a standard photoionization analysis and the much larger transverse size estimates inferred from the observation of common absorption in the spectra of close quasar pairs.},

  abstract = {Over the next five years, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will use 10 spectrographs with 5000 fibers on the 4m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to conduct the first Stage-IV dark energy galaxy survey. At \$z {$<$} 0.6\$, the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) will produce the most detailed map of the Universe during the dark energy dominated epoch with redshifts of {$>$}10 million galaxies over 14,000 deg\$\^2\$. In this work, we present and validate the final BGS target selection and survey design. From the Legacy Surveys, BGS will target a \$r {$<$} 19.5\$ magnitude-limited sample (BGS Bright); a fainter \$19.5 {$<$} r {$<$} 20.175\$ sample, color-selected to have high redshift efficiency (BGS Faint); and a smaller low-z quasar sample. BGS will observe these targets using exposure times, scaled to achieve uniform completeness, and visit each point on the footprint three times. We use observations from the Survey Validation programs conducted prior to the main survey along with realistic simulations to show that BGS can complete its strategy and make optimal use of `bright' time. We demonstrate that BGS targets have stellar contamination {$<$}1\% and that their densities do not depend strongly on imaging properties. We also confirm that BGS Bright will achieve {$>$}80\% fiber assignment efficiency. Finally, we show that BGS Bright and Faint will achieve {$>$}95\% redshift success rates with no significant dependence on observing conditions. BGS meets the requirements for an extensive range of scientific applications. BGS will yield the most precise Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-Space Distortions measurements at \$z {$<$} 0.4\$. It also presents opportunities to exploit new methods that require highly complete and dense galaxy samples (e.g. N-point statistics, multi-tracers). BGS further provides a powerful tool to study galaxy populations and the relations between galaxies and dark matter.},

  abstract = {Fibre-fed multi-object spectroscopic surveys, with their ability to collect an unprecedented number of redshifts, currently dominate large-scale structure studies. However, physical constraints limit these surveys from successfully collecting redshifts from galaxies too close to each other on the focal plane. This ultimately leads to significant systematic effects on galaxy clustering measurements. Using simulated mock catalogues, we demonstrate that fibre collisions have a significant impact on the power spectrum, P(k), monopole and quadrupole that exceeds sample variance at scales smaller than k ∼ 0.1 h Mpc-1. We present two methods to account for fibre collisions in the power spectrum. The first, statistically reconstructs the clustering of fibre-collided galaxy pairs by modelling the distribution of the line-of-sight displacements between them. It also properly accounts for fibre collisions in the shot-noise correction term of the P(k) estimator. Using this method, we recover the true P(k) monopole of the mock catalogues with residuals of {$<$}0.5 per cent at k = 0.3 h Mpc-1 and {$<$}4 per cent at k = 0.83 h Mpc-1 - a significant improvement over existing correction methods. The quadrupole, however, does not improve significantly. The second method models the effect of fibre collisions on the power spectrum as a convolution with a configuration space top-hat function that depends on the physical scale of fibre collisions. It directly computes theoretical predictions of the fibre-collided P(k) multipoles and reduces the influence of smaller scales to a set of nuisance parameters. Using this method, we reliably model the effect of fibre collisions on the monopole and quadrupole down to the scale limits of theoretical predictions. The methods we present in this paper will allow us to robustly analyse galaxy power spectrum multipole measurements to much smaller scales than previously possible.},

Merely considering linear-order theory allows us to accurately describe the data on the entire available range of scales and to probe void-centric distances down to about \$2h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. Common systematics, such as the Fingers-of-God effect, scale-dependent galaxy bias, and nonlinear clustering do not seem to play a significant role in our analysis.

  abstract = {We report novel cosmological constraints obtained from cosmic voids in the final BOSS DR12 dataset. They arise from the joint analysis of geometric and dynamic distortions of average void shapes (i.e., the stacked void-galaxy cross-correlation function) in redshift space. Our model uses tomographic deprojection to infer real-space void profiles and self-consistently accounts for the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD) without any prior assumptions on cosmology or structure formation. It is derived from first physical principles and provides an extremely good description of the data at linear perturbation order. We validate this model with the help of mock catalogs and apply it to the final BOSS data to constrain the RSD and AP parameters \$f/b\$ and \$D\_AH/c\$, where \$f\$ is the linear growth rate, \$b\$ the linear galaxy bias, \$D\_A\$ the comoving angular diameter distance, \$H\$ the Hubble rate, and \$c\$ the speed of light. In addition, we include two nuisance parameters in our analysis to marginalize over potential systematics. We obtain \$f/b=0.540\textbackslash pm0.091\$ and \$D\_AH/c=0.588\textbackslash pm0.004\$ from the full void sample at a mean redshift of \$z=0.51\$. In a flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, this implies \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}=0.312\textbackslash pm0.020\$ for the present-day matter density parameter. When we use additional information from the survey mocks to calibrate our model, these constraints improve to \$f/b=0.347\textbackslash pm0.023\$, \$D\_AH/c=0.588\textbackslash pm0.003\$, and \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}=0.311\textbackslash pm0.019\$. However, we emphasize that the calibration depends on the specific model of cosmology and structure formation assumed in the mocks, so the calibrated results should be considered less robust. Nevertheless, our calibration-independent constraints are among the tightest of their kind to date, demonstrating the immense potential of using cosmic voids for cosmology in current and future data.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a number of ways to improve on the standard method of measuring the two-point correlation, or covariance, function of large-scale structure in the universe. (1) It is shown that the statistic commonly used to estimate the covariance function has the defect that its uncertainty on large scales is limited by the uncertainty in the mean density. An alternative estimator is proposed which does not suffer from this limitation. The alternative estimator should be more accurate all on scales, but particularly on large scales where the covariance function is small. (2) Use of the sample mean biases the estimate of the covariance function by missing out variance on scales comparable to the scale of the sample. A revised estimator of the covariance function is proposed which allows missing large-scale variance to be restored. (3) It is shown from first principles how to estimate the uncertainties in the covariance function of a sample. A practical way to carry out the error analysis is suggested. (4) An approximate minimum-variance pair weighting for the calculation of the covariance function is derived, and a practical implementation is suggested. (5) The question of the calculation of background pair counts is discussed, with emphasis on the problem of the anisotropy of the redshift covariance function. Various analytic results are presented on angular integrals.},

The restrictions on the mask are (i) that each edge must be part of some circle on the sphere (but not necessarily a great circle), and (ii) that the weight within each subregion of the mask must be constant. The scheme works by resolving a mask into disjoint polygons, convex angular regions bounded by arbitrary numbers of edges. The polygons may be regarded as the `pixels' of a mask, with the feature that the pixels are allowed to take a rather general shape, rather than following some predefined regular pattern. Among other things, the scheme includes facilities to compute the spherical harmonics of the angular mask, and Data-Random and Random-Random angular integrals. A software package MANGLE that implements this scheme, along with complete software documentation, is available at http://casa.colorado.edu/\textasciitilde ajsh/mangle/.},

  abstract = {Non-linear evolution causes the galaxy power spectrum to become broadly correlated over different wavenumbers. It is shown that pre-whitening the power spectrum - transforming the power spectrum in such a way that the noise covariance becomes proportional to the unit matrix - greatly narrows the covariance of power. The eigenfunctions of the covariance of the pre-whitened non-linear power spectrum provide a set of almost uncorrelated non-linear modes somewhat analogous to the Fourier modes of the power spectrum itself in the linear, Gaussian regime. These almost uncorrelated modes make it possible to construct a near-minimum variance estimator and Fisher matrix of the pre-whitened non-linear power spectrum analogous to the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock (FKP) estimator of the linear power spectrum. The paper concludes with summary recipes, in gourmet, fine and fastfood versions, of how to measure the pre-whitened non-linear power spectrum from a galaxy survey in the FKP approximation. An appendix presents FFTLog, a code for taking the fast Fourier or Hankel transform of a periodic sequence of logarithmically spaced points, which proves useful in some of the manipulations.},

The ratio quantifies a Bayesian confidence in our ability to combine the datasets. This interpretation is prior-dependent, with wider prior widths boosting the confidence. We therefore propose that if there are any reasonable priors which reduce the confidence to below unity, then we cannot assert that the datasets are compatible. Computing the evidence ratios for the DES first year analysis and Planck, given that narrower priors drop the confidence to below unity, we conclude that DES and Planck are, in a Bayesian sense, incompatible under LCDM. Additionally we compute ratios which confirm the consensus that measurements of the acoustic scale by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS) are compatible with Planck, whilst direct measurements of the acceleration rate of the Universe by the SHOES collaboration are not. We propose a modification to the Bayes ratio which removes the prior dependency using Kullback-Leibler divergences, and using this statistical test find Planck in strong tension with SHOES, in moderate tension with DES, and in no tension with SDSS. We propose this statistic as the optimal way to compare datasets, ahead of the next DES data releases, as well as future surveys. Finally, as an element of these calculations, we introduce in a cosmological setting the Bayesian model dimensionality, which is a parameterisation-independent measure of the number of parameters that a given dataset constrains.},

  abstract = {Measurements of line-of-sight dependent clustering via the galaxy power spectrum's multipole moments constitute a powerful tool for testing theoretical models in large-scale structure. Recent work shows that this measurement, including a moving line-of-sight, can be accelerated using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) by decomposing the Legendre polynomials into products of Cartesian vectors. Here, we present a faster, optimal means of using FFTs for this measurement. We avoid redundancy present in the Cartesian decomposition by using a spherical harmonic decomposition of the Legendre polynomials. Consequently, our method is substantially faster: a given multipole of order \$\textbackslash ell\$ requires only \$2\textbackslash ell+1\$ FFTs rather than the \$(\textbackslash ell+1)(\textbackslash ell+2)/2\$ FFTs of the Cartesian approach. For the hexadecapole (\$\textbackslash ell = 4\$), this translates to \$40\textbackslash\%\$ fewer FFTs, with increased savings for higher \$\textbackslash ell\$. The reduction in wall-clock time enables the calculation of finely-binned wedges in \$P(k,\textbackslash mu)\$, obtained by computing multipoles up to a large \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\$ and combining them. This transformation has a number of advantages. We demonstrate that by using non-uniform bins in \$\textbackslash mu\$, we can isolate plane-of-sky (angular) systematics to a narrow bin at \$\textbackslash mu \textbackslash simeq 0\$ while eliminating the contamination from all other bins. We also show that the covariance matrix of clustering wedges binned uniformly in \$\textbackslash mu\$ becomes ill-conditioned when combining multipoles up to large values of \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\$, but that the problem can be avoided with non-uniform binning. As an example, we present results using \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}=16\$, for which our procedure requires a factor of 3.4 fewer FFTs than the Cartesian method, while removing the first \$\textbackslash mu\$ bin leads only to a 7\% increase in statistical error on \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8\$, as compared to a 54\% increase with \$\textbackslash ell\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}=4\$.},

We detect the CMB lensing convergence-quasar cross-power spectrum at 5.4σ significance. The cross-power spectrum provides a quasar clustering bias measurement that is expected to be particularly robust against systematic effects. The redshift distribution of the quasar sample has a median redshift z ≈ 1.55, and an effective redshift about 1.51. The best-fitting bias of the quasar sample is b\textsubscript{q} = 2.43 ± 0.45, corresponding to a host halo mass of log \_\{10\}(M/h\^\{-1 M\_☉ \} ) = 12.54\^\{+0.25\}\_\{-0.36\}. This is broadly consistent with the previous literature on quasars with a similar redshift range and selection. Since our constraint on the bias comes from the cross-correlation between quasars and CMB lensing, we expect it to be robust to a wide range of possible systematic effects that may contaminate the autocorrelation of quasars. We checked for a number of systematic effects from both CMB lensing and quasar overdensity, and found that all systematics are consistent with null within 2σ. The data are not sensitive to a possible scale dependence of the bias at present, but we expect that as the number of quasars increases [in future surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)], it is likely that strong constraints on the scale dependence of the bias can be obtained.},

We construct a template for the lensing B-mode signal by combining E-mode polarization measured by SPTpol with estimates of the lensing potential from a Herschel-SPIRE map of the cosmic infrared background. We compare this template to the B modes measured directly by SPTpol, finding a nonzero correlation at 7.7σ significance.

  abstract = {Aims:The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain  model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods: We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results: We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p{$>$}n.},

  abstract = {Recent results have suggested that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could provide enough photons to reionise the Universe. We assess the viability of this scenario using a semi-numerical framework for modeling reionisation, to which we add a quasar contribution by constructing a Quasar Halo Occupation Distribution (QHOD) based on Giallongo et al. observations. Assuming a constant QHOD, we find that an AGN-only model cannot simultaneously match observations of the optical depth \$\textbackslash tau\_e\$, neutral fraction, and ionising emissivity. Such a model predicts \$\textbackslash tau\_e\$ too low by \$\textbackslash sim 2\textbackslash sigma\$ relative to Planck constraints, and reionises the Universe at \$z\textbackslash lesssim 5\$. Arbitrarily increasing the AGN emissivity to match these results yields a strong mismatch with the observed ionising emissivity at \$z\textbackslash sim 5\$. If we instead assume a redshift-independent AGN luminosity function yielding an emissivity evolution like that assumed in Madau \& Haardt model, then we can match \$\textbackslash tau\_e\$ albeit with late reionisation, however such evolution is inconsistent with observations at \$z\textbackslash sim 4-6\$ and poorly motivated physically. These results arise because AGN are more biased towards massive halos than typical reionising galaxies, resulting in stronger clustering and later formation times. AGN-dominated models produce larger ionising bubbles that are reflected in \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash times 2\$ more 21cm power on all scales. A model with equal parts galaxies and AGN contribution is still (barely) consistent with observations, but could be distinguished using next-generation 21cm experiments HERA and SKA-low. We conclude that, even with recent claims of more faint AGN than previously thought, AGN are highly unlikely to dominate the ionising photon budget for reionisation.},

Remarkably, this tendency persists out to scales far larger than the virial radius of the halo hosting the central. Therefore, conformity manifestly violates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir exclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a series studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the galaxy-dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity on scales r ˜ 1-5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be correctly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that ejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then invoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of galaxies and haloes. We find that this model produces a strong signal, and that central galaxies are solely responsible. We conclude that large-scale `two-halo' conformity represents a smoking gun of central galaxy assembly bias, and indicates that contemporary models of satellite quenching have systematically overestimated the influence of post-infall processes.},

Conventional HOD formulations assume that only halo mass governs the galaxy-halo connection. Violations of this assumption, known as galaxy assembly bias, threaten the HOD programme. We introduce decorated HODs, a new, flexible class of models designed to account for assembly bias. Decorated HODs minimally expand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditional and novel HOD parameters. We use decorated HODs to quantify the influence of assembly bias on clustering and lensing statistics. For SDSS-like samples, the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering can be as large as a factor of 2 on r ˜ 200 kpc scales and ˜15 per cent in the linear regime. Assembly bias can either enhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increases clustering on scales r ≲ 1 Mpc. We performed our calculations with HALOTOOLS, an open-source, community-driven PYTHON package for studying the galaxy-halo connection (http://halotools.readthedocs.org). We conclude by describing the use of decorated HODs to treat assembly bias in otherwise conventional likelihood analyses.},

We consider the general problem of estimating parameters from data, and consider how one can use Fisher matrices to analyse survey designs before any data are taken, to see whether the survey will actually do what is required. We outline numerical methods for estimating parameters from data, including Monte Carlo Markov Chains and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We also look at Model Selection, which covers various scenarios such as whether an extra parameter is preferred by the data, or answering wider questions such as which theoretical framework is favoured, using General Relativity and braneworld gravity as an example.

  abstract = {We investigate—in a generic setting—the regime of  applicability of the Alcock-Paczyński (AP) scaling conventionally applied to test different cosmological models, given a fiducial measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) characteristic scale in the galaxy 2-point correlation function. We quantify the error in conventional AP scaling methods, for which our ignorance about the true cosmology is parameterised in terms of two constant AP scaling parameters. We propose a new, and as it turns out, improved version of the constant AP scaling, also consisting of two scaling parameters. The two constant AP scaling methods are almost indistinguishable when the fiducial model used in data reduction and the "true" underlying cosmology are not differing substantially in terms of metric gradients, but are otherwise expected to differ. Our new methods can be applied to existing analyses through a reinterpretation of the results of the conventional AP scaling. This reinterpretation might be important in model universes where curvature gradients above the scale of galaxies are significant. We test our theoretical findings on ΛCDM mock catalogues. The conventional constant AP scaling methods are surprisingly successful for pairs of large-scale metrics, but eventually break down when toy models allowing for large metric gradients are tested. The new constant AP scaling methods proposed in this paper are efficient for all test models examined. We find systematic errors of \textasciitilde 1\% in the recovery of the BAO scale when the true model is distant from the fiducial, which cannot be attributed to any constant AP approximation. The level of systematic uncertainty is robust to the exact fitting method employed. This indicates that caution must be taken with the error budget when extrapolating the BAO acoustic scale measurements obtained in the standard literature.},

Notwithstanding the triumphs of Einstein's theory, the tenacious challenges of modern cosmology and of particle physics have motivated the exploration of further generalised theories of spacetime. Even though Einstein's interpretation of gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime is commonly adopted, the assignment of geometrical concepts to gravity is ambiguous because General Relativity allows three entirely different, but equivalent approaches of which Einstein's interpretation is only one. From a field-theoretical perspective, however, the construction of a consistent theory for a Lorentz-invariant massless spin-2 particle uniquely leads to General Relativity. Keeping Lorentz invariance then implies that any modification of General Relativity will inevitably introduce additional propagating degrees of freedom into the gravity sector. Adopting this perspective, we will review the recent progress in constructing consistent field theories of gravity based on additional scalar, vector and tensor fields. Within this conceptual framework, we will discuss theories with Galileons, with Lagrange densities as constructed by Horndeski and beyond, extended to DHOST interactions, or containing generalized Proca fields and extensions thereof, or several Proca fields, as well as bigravity theories and scalar-vector-tensor theories. We will review the motivation of their inception, different formulations, and essential results obtained within these classes of theories together with their empirical viability.},

The velocities of dark matter halos with a wide range of masses would exhibit deviations from general relativity at the (5-10)σ level. We examine strategies for detecting these deviations in galaxy redshift and peculiar velocity surveys. If detected, this signature would be a "smoking gun" for modified gravity.},

The distribution of H I column densities agrees with existing data to within a factor of \textasciitilde 2 over most of the range from 1014 cm-2 to 1022 cm-2; i.e., from unsaturated Ly alpha forest lines to damped Ly alpha systems.

Most of the low column density absorption arises in large, flattened structures of moderate or even relatively low overdensity, so there is no sharp distinction between the Ly alpha forest and the "Gunn-Peterson" absorption produced by the smooth intergalactic medium. Our results demonstrate that a Ly alpha forest like that observed develops naturally in a hierarchical clustering scenario with a photoionizing background. Comparison between simulations and high-resolution QSO spectra should open a new regime for testing theories of cosmic structure formation.},

  abstract = {The accurate measurement of extragalactic distances is a central challenge of modern astronomy, being required for any realistic description of the age, geometry and fate of the Universe. The measurement of relative extragalactic distances has become fairly routine, but estimates of absolute distances are rare1. In the vicinity of the Sun, direct geometric techniques for obtaining absolute distances, such as orbital parallax, are feasible, but such techniques have hitherto been difficult to apply to other galaxies. As a result, uncertainties in the expansion rate and age of the Universe are dominated by uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the extragalactic distance ladder2. Here we report a geometric distance to the galaxy NGC4258, which we infer from the direct measurement of orbital motions in a disk of gas surrounding the nucleus of this galaxy. The distance so determined—7.2 ± 0.3\,Mpc—is the most precise absolute extragalactic distance yet measured, and is likely to play an important role in future distance-scale calibrations.},

Empirical relationships between redshifts based on (i) CaII H\&K host galaxy absorption, (ii) quasar [OII]3728, (iii) [OIII]4960, 5008 emission and (iv) cross-correlation (with a master-quasar template) that includes, at increasing quasar redshift, the prominent MgII2799, CIII]1908 and CIV1549 emission lines are established as a function of quasar redshift and luminosity. New redshifts in the resulting catalogue possess systematic biases, a factor of 20 lower compared to the SDSS redshift values; systematic effects are reduced to the level of (30kms-1) per unit redshift or per unit absolute magnitude. Redshift errors, including components due both to internal reproducibility and to the intrinsic quasar-to-quasar variation among the population, are available for all quasars in the catalogue.

This combination of large-scale structure probes breaks the degeneracies between cosmological parameters for individual observables, resulting in a constraint on the structure growth parameter \$S\_8=\textbackslash sigma\_8 \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}/0.3\} = 0.766\^\{+0.020\}\_\{-0.014\}\$, that has the same overall precision as that reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave background observations from Planck. The recovered \$S\_8\$ amplitude is low, however, by \$8.3 \textbackslash pm 2.6\$ \% relative to Planck. This result builds from a series of KiDS-1000 analyses where we validate our methodology with variable depth mock galaxy surveys, our lensing calibration with image simulations and null-tests, and our optical-to-near-infrared redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues and a spectroscopic-photometric clustering analysis. The systematic uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded through as nuisance parameters in our cosmological analysis. Inspecting the offset between the marginalised posterior distributions, we find that the \$S\_8\$-difference with Planck is driven by a tension in the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. We quantify the level of agreement between the CMB and our large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding differences with a significance ranging between \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash! 3\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, when considering the offset in \$S\_\{8\}\$, and \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash! 2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, when considering the full multi-dimensional parameter space.},

  abstract = {We measure cosmic weak lensing shear power spectra with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey first-year shear catalog covering 137 deg2 of the sky. Thanks to the high effective galaxy number density of ∼17 arcmin-2, even after conservative cuts such as a magnitude cut of i {$<$} 24.5 and photometric redshift cut of 0.3 ≤ z ≤ 1.5, we obtain a high-significance measurement of the cosmic shear power spectra in four tomographic redshift bins, achieving a total signal-to-noise ratio of 16 in the multipole range 300 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1900. We carefully account for various uncertainties in our analysis including the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, scatters and biases in photometric redshifts, residual uncertainties in the shear measurement, and modeling of the matter power spectrum. The accuracy of our power spectrum measurement method as well as our analytic model of the covariance matrix are tested against realistic mock shear catalogs. For a flat Λ cold dark matter model, we find S 8≡ σ \_8(Ω \_m/0.3)\^$\alpha$ =0.800\^\{+0.029\}\_\{-0.028\} for $\alpha$ = 0.45 (S \_8=0.780\^\{+0.030\}\_\{-0.033\} for $\alpha$ = 0.5) from our HSC tomographic cosmic shear analysis alone. In comparison with Planck cosmic microwave background constraints, our results prefer slightly lower values of S8, although metrics such as the Bayesian evidence ratio test do not show significant evidence for discordance between these results. We study the effect of possible additional systematic errors that are unaccounted for in our fiducial cosmic shear analysis, and find that they can shift the best-fit values of S8 by up to ∼0.6 σ in both directions. The full HSC survey data will contain several times more area, and will lead to significantly improved cosmological constraints.},

  abstract = {The nominal mission maps from the Planck satellite contain a wealth of information about secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), including those induced by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and gravitational lensing. As both the tSZ and CMB lensing signals trace the large-scale matter density field, the anisotropies sourced by these processes are expected to be correlated. We report the first detection of this cross-correlation signal, which we measure at 6.2σ significance using the Planck data. We take advantage of Planck's multifrequency coverage to construct a tSZ map using internal linear combination techniques, which we subsequently cross-correlate with the publicly-released Planck CMB lensing potential map. The cross-correlation is subject to contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), which is known to correlate strongly with CMB lensing. We correct for this contamination via cross-correlating our tSZ map with the Planck 857 GHz map and confirm the robustness of our measurement using several null tests. We interpret the signal using halo model calculations, which indicate that the tSZ-CMB lensing cross-correlation is a unique probe of the physics of intracluster gas in high-redshift, low-mass groups and clusters. Our results are consistent with extrapolations of existing gas physics models to this previously unexplored regime and show clear evidence for contributions from both the one- and two-halo terms, but no statistically significant evidence for contributions from diffuse, unbound gas outside of collapsed halos. We also show that the amplitude of the signal depends rather sensitively on the amplitude of fluctuations (σ\textsubscript{8}) and the matter density (Ω\textsubscript{m}), scaling as σ\textsubscript{8}\textsuperscript{6.1}Ω\textsubscript{m}\textsuperscript{1.5} at l = 1000. We constrain the degenerate combination σ\textsubscript{8}(Ω\textsubscript{m}/0.282)\textsuperscript{0.26} = 0.824±0.029, a result that is in less tension with primordial CMB constraints than some recent tSZ analyses. We also combine our measurement with the Planck measurement of the tSZ auto-power spectrum to demonstrate a technique that can in principle constrain both cosmology and the physics of intracluster gas simultaneously. Our detection is a direct confirmation that hot, ionized gas traces the dark matter distribution over a wide range of scales in the universe ( \textasciitilde{} 0.1-50 Mpc/h). {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year WMAP data, in conjunction with additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter LCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities, Omegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega\_L, are each determined to a precision of \textasciitilde 1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r{$<$}0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is {$<$}0.44 eV (95\% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

  abstract = {We compare the performance of four state-of-the-art models for extracting isotropic measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale. To do this, we created a new, public, modular code Barry, which contains datasets, model fitting tools, and model implementations incorporating different descriptions of non-linear physics and algorithms for isolating the BAO feature. These are then evaluated for bias, correlation, and fitting strength using mock power spectra and correlation functions developed for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. Our main findings are as follows: 1) All of the models can recover unbiased constraints when fit to the pre- and post-reconstruction simulations. 2) Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average, although the distribution of mock \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\$ values indicates these are underestimated. 3) Allowing the BAO damping scale to vary can provide tighter constraints for some mocks, but is an artificial improvement that only arises when noise randomly sharpens the BAO peak. 4) Unlike recent claims in the literature when utilising a BAO Extractor technique, we find no improvement in the accuracy of the recovered BAO scale. 5) We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties. Overall, Barry provides an excellent framework for performing the cosmological analyses for upcoming surveys, and for rapidly testing and validating new models.},

  abstract = {The baryon-acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest is one of the key probes of the cosmic expansion rate at redshifts z\textasciitilde 2.5, well before dark energy is believed to have become dynamically significant. A key advantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature and hence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other cosmological probes. However, if the Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest transmission is sensitive to the initial streaming velocity of the baryons relative to the dark matter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted. Here we investigate this sensitivity using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of small regions of the intergalactic medium with a range of box sizes and physics assumptions; each simulation starts from initial conditions at the kinematic decoupling era (z\textasciitilde 1059), undergoes a discrete change from neutral gas to ionized gas thermal evolution at reionization (z\textasciitilde 8), and is finally processed into a Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest transmitted flux cube. Streaming velocities suppress small-scale structure, leading to less violent relaxation after reionization. The changes in the gas distribution and temperature-density relation at low redshift are more subtle, due to the convergent temperature evolution in the ionized phase. The change in the BAO scale is estimated to be of the order of 0.12\% at z=2.5; some of the major uncertainties and avenues for future improvement are discussed. The predicted streaming velocity shift would be a subdominant but not negligible effect (of order \$0.26\textbackslash sigma\$) for the upcoming DESI Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest survey, and exceeds the cosmic variance floor. It is hoped that this study will motivate additional theoretical work on the magnitude of the BAO shift, both in the Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest and in other tracers of large-scale structure.},

  abstract = {Supernova (SN) cosmology without spectroscopic confirmation is an exciting new frontier, which we address here with the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) algorithm and the full three years of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II Supernova Survey (SDSS-II SN). BEAMS is a Bayesian framework for using data from multiple species in statistical inference when one has the probability that each data point belongs to a given species, corresponding in this context to different types of SNe with their probabilities derived from their multi-band light curves. We run the BEAMS algorithm on both Gaussian and more realistic SNANA simulations with of order 104 SNe, testing the algorithm against various pitfalls one might expect in the new and somewhat uncharted territory of photometric SN cosmology. We compare the performance of BEAMS to that of both mock spectroscopic surveys and photometric samples that have been cut using typical selection criteria. The latter typically either are biased due to contamination or have significantly larger contours in the cosmological parameters due to small data sets. We then apply BEAMS to the 792 SDSS-II photometric SNe with host spectroscopic redshifts. In this case, BEAMS reduces the area of the Ω m , ΩΛ contours by a factor of three relative to the case where only spectroscopically confirmed data are used (297 SNe). In the case of flatness, the constraints obtained on the matter density applying BEAMS to the photometric SDSS-II data are ΩBEAMS m = 0.194 ± 0.07. This illustrates the potential power of BEAMS for future large photometric SN surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) surveyed 14,555 deg2, and  delivered over a trillion pixels of imaging data. We present a study of galaxy clustering using 900,000 luminous galaxies with photometric redshifts, spanning between z = 0.45 and z = 0.65, constructed from the SDSS using methods described in Ross et al. This data set spans 11,000 deg2 and probes a volume of 3 h -3 Gpc3, making it the largest volume ever used for galaxy clustering measurements. We describe in detail the construction of the survey window function and various systematics affecting our measurement. With such a large volume, high-precision cosmological constraints can be obtained given careful control and understanding of the observational systematics. We present a novel treatment of the observational systematics and its applications to the clustering signals from the data set. In this paper, we measure the angular clustering using an optimal quadratic estimator at four redshift slices with an accuracy of \textasciitilde 15\%, with a bin size of δ l = 10 on scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs; at l \textasciitilde{} 40-400). We also apply corrections to the power spectra due to systematics and derive cosmological constraints using the full shape of the power spectra. For a flat ΛCDM model, when combined with cosmic microwave background Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 (WMAP7) and H 0 constraints from using 600 Cepheids observed by Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3; HST), we find ΩΛ = 0.73 ± 0.019 and H 0 to be 70.5 ± 1.6 s-1 Mpc-1 km. For an open ΛCDM model, when combined with WMAP7 + HST, we find Ω K = 0.0035 ± 0.0054, improved over WMAP7+HST alone by 40\%. For a wCDM model, when combined with WMAP7+HST+SN, we find w = -1.071 ± 0.078, and H 0 to be 71.3 ± 1.7 s-1 Mpc-1 km, which is competitive with the latest large-scale structure constraints from large spectroscopic surveys such as the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) and WiggleZ. We also find that systematic-corrected power spectra give consistent constraints on cosmological models when compared with pre-systematic correction power spectra in the angular scales of interest. The SDSS-III Data Release 8 (SDSS-III DR8) Angular Clustering Data allow a wide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion (via BAO), Gaussianity of initial conditions, and neutrino masses. Here, we refer to our companion papers for further investigations using the clustering data. Our calculation of the survey selection function, systematics maps, and likelihood function for the COSMOMC package will be released at http://portal.nersc.gov/project/boss/galaxy/photoz/.},

  abstract = {Surveys of galaxy distances and radial peculiar velocities can be used to reconstruct the large-scale structure. Other than systematic errors in the zero-point calibration of the galaxy distances the main source of uncertainties of such data is errors on the distance moduli, assumed here to be Gaussian and thus turning into lognormal errors on distances and velocities. Naively treated, this leads to spurious nearby outflow and strong infall at larger distances. The lognormal bias is corrected here and tested against mock data extracted from a ΛCDM simulation, designed to statistically follow the grouped Cosmicflows-3 (CF3) data. Considering a subsample of data points, all of which have the same true distances or the same redshifts, the lognormal bias arises because the means of the distributions of observed distances and velocities are skewed off the means of the true distances and velocities. However, the medians are invariant under the lognormal transformation. This invariance allows the Gaussianization of the distances and velocities and the removal of the lognormal bias. This bias Gaussianization correction (BGc) algorithm is tested against mock CF3 catalogues. The test consists of a comparison of the BGc estimated with the simulated distances and velocities and of an examination of the Wiener filter reconstruction from the BGc data. Indeed, the BGc eliminates the lognormal bias. The estimation of Hubble's constant (H0) is also tested. The residual of the BGc-estimated H0 from the simulated values is \$-0.6\textbackslash pm 0.7\{\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm km \textbackslash{} s\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$, and is dominated by the cosmic variance. The BGc correction of the actual CF3 data yields \$H\_0=75.8\textbackslash pm 1.1\{\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm km \textbackslash{} s\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$.},

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest. We emphasize that sampling is a method for doing integrals; this guides our thinking about how MCMC output is best used.},

We find that for a Gaussian smoothing of 4 Mpc/h, the method has only small systematic biases at the level of 5\%.

Whether the hydration is molecular water (H2O) or other hydroxyl (OH) compounds is unknown and there are no established methods to distinguish the two using the 3\,µm band4. However, a fundamental vibration of molecular water produces a spectral signature at 6\,µm that is not shared by other hydroxyl compounds5. Here, we present observations of the Moon at 6\,µm using the NASA/DLR Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Observations reveal a 6\,µm emission feature at high lunar latitudes due to the presence of molecular water on the lunar surface. On the basis of the strength of the 6\,µm band, we estimate abundances of about 100 to 400\,µg\,g−1 H2O. We find that the distribution of water over the small latitude range is a result of local geology and is probably not a global phenomenon. Lastly, we suggest that a majority of the water we detect must be stored within glasses or in voids between grains sheltered from the harsh lunar environment, allowing the water to remain on the lunar surface.},

In this paper, we study how LRGs occupy massive haloes via counts in clusters and reveal several unexpected trends. Using the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer) cluster catalogue, we derive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness. We show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of central LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function. At halo masses of 10\textsuperscript{14.5} M\textsubscript{☉}, we find N\textsubscript{cen} = 0.73 compared to N\textsubscript{cen} = 0.89 from correlation studies. Our central occupation function for LRGs converges to 0.95 at large halo masses. A strong anticorrelation between central luminosity and cluster mass at fixed richness is required to reconcile our results with those based on clustering studies. We derive the probability that the brightest cluster member is not the central galaxy. We find P\textsubscript{BNC} ≈ 20-30 per cent which is a factor of ̃2 lower than the value found by Skibba et al. Finally, we study the radial offsets of bright non-central LRGs from cluster centres and show that bright non-central LRGs follow a different radial distribution compared to red cluster members. This work demonstrates that even the most massive clusters do not always have an LRG at the centre, and that the brightest galaxy in a cluster is not always the central galaxy.},

  abstract = {We measure the anisotropic clustering of the quasar sample from Data  Release 16 (DR16) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). A sample of 343 708 spectroscopically confirmed quasars between redshift 0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 are used as tracers of the underlying dark matter field. In comparison with DR14 sample, the final sample doubles the number of objects as well as the survey area. In this paper, we present the analysis in configuration space by measuring the two-point correlation function and decomposing it using the Legendre polynomials. For the full-shape analysis of the Legendre multipole moments, we measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance and the growth rate of the cosmic structure. At an effective redshift of zeff = 1.48, we measure the comoving angular diameter distance DM(zeff)/rdrag = 30.66 ± 0.88, the Hubble distance DH(zeff)/rdrag = 13.11 ± 0.52, and the product of the linear growth rate and the rms linear mass fluctuation on scales of \$8 \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ , fσ8(zeff) = 0.439 ± 0.048. The accuracy of these measurements is confirmed using an extensive set of mock simulations developed for the quasar sample. The uncertainties on the distance and growth rate measurements have been reduced substantially (∼45 and ∼30 per cent) with respect to the DR14 results. We also perform a BAO-only analysis to cross check the robustness of the methodology of the full-shape analysis. Combining our analysis with the Fourier-space analysis, we arrive at \$D\^\{\{\textbackslash bf c\}\}\_\{\textbackslash rm M\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_\{\textbackslash rm drag\} = 30.21 \textbackslash pm 0.79\$ , \$D\^\{\{\textbackslash bf c\}\}\_\{\textbackslash rm H\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_\{\textbackslash rm drag\} = 13.23 \textbackslash pm 0.47\$ , and \$f\textbackslash sigma \_8\^\{\{\textbackslash bf c\}\}(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}) = 0.462 \textbackslash pm 0.045\$ .},

  abstract = {We explore extensions to the ΛCDM cosmology using measurements of  the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the recent SPT-SZ survey, along with data from WMAP7 and measurements of H 0 and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). We check for consistency within ΛCDM between these data sets, and find some tension. The CMB alone gives weak support to physics beyond ΛCDM, due to a slight trend relative to ΛCDM of decreasing power toward smaller angular scales. While it may be due to statistical fluctuation, this trend could also be explained by several extensions. We consider running of the primordial spectral index (dns /dln k), as well as two extensions that modify the damping tail power (the primordial helium abundance Yp and the effective number of neutrino species N eff) and one that modifies the large-scale power due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (the sum of neutrino masses ∑m ν). These extensions have similar observational consequences and are partially degenerate when considered simultaneously. Of the six one-parameter extensions considered, we find CMB to have the largest preference for dns /dln k with -0.046 {$<$} dns /dln k {$<$} -0.003 at 95\% confidence, which strengthens to a 2.7σ indication of dns /dln k {$<$} 0 from CMB+BAO+H 0. Detectable dns /dln k ≠ 0 is difficult to explain in the context of single-field, slow-roll inflation models. We find N eff = 3.62 ± 0.48 for the CMB, which tightens to N eff = 3.71 ± 0.35 from CMB+BAO+H 0. Larger values of N eff relieve the mild tension between CMB, BAO, and H 0. When the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy cluster abundances (SPT\_\{CL\}) data are also included, we obtain N eff = 3.29 ± 0.31. Allowing for ∑m ν gives a 3.0σ detection of ∑m ν {$>$} 0 from CMB+BAO+H 0 +SPT\_\{CL\}. The median value is (0.32 ± 0.11) eV, a factor of six above the lower bound set by neutrino oscillation observations. All data sets except H 0 show some preference for massive neutrinos; data combinations including H 0 favor nonzero masses only if BAO data are also included. We also constrain the two-parameter extensions N eff + ∑m ν and N eff + Yp to explore constraints on additional light species and big bang nucleosynthesis, respectively.},

Our sample, which we denote MGS, covers 6,813 deg\$\^2\$ with an effective redshift \$z\_\{eff\}=0.15\$ and is described in our companion paper (Paper I), which concentrates on BAO measurements. In order to validate the fitting methods used in both papers, and derive errors, we create and analyse 1000 mock catalogues using a new algorithm called PICOLA to generate accurate dark matter fields. Haloes are then selected using a friends-of-friends algorithm, and populated with galaxies using a Halo-Occupation Distribution fitted to the data. Using errors derived from these mocks, we fit a model to the monopole and quadrupole moments of the MGS correlation function. If we assume no Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect (valid at \$z=0.15\$ for any smooth model of the expansion history), we measure the amplitude of the velocity field, \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}\$, at \$z=0.15\$ to be \$0.49\_\{-0.14\}\^\{+0.15\}\$. We also measure \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}\$ including the AP effect. This latter measurement can be freely combined with recent Cosmic Microwave Background results to constrain the growth index of fluctuations, \$\textbackslash gamma\$. Assuming a background \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology and combining with current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data we find \$\textbackslash gamma = 0.64 \textbackslash pm 0.09\$, which is consistent with the prediction of General Relativity (\$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash approx 0.55\$), though with a slight preference for higher \$\textbackslash gamma\$ and hence models with weaker gravitational interactions.},

We study degeneracies in models with flat and non-flat spatial sections, non-trivial dark energy and massive neutrinos, and investigate the importance of various physical degeneracy-breaking effects. We test the CAMB power spectrum code for numerical accuracy, and demonstrate that the numerical calculations are accurate enough for degeneracies to be broken mainly by true physical effects (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, CMB lensing and geometrical and other effects through recombination) rather than numerical artefacts. We quantify the impact of CMB lensing on the power spectra, which inevitably provides degeneracy-breaking information even without using information in the non-Gaussianity. Finally we check the numerical accuracy of sample-based parameter constraints using CAMB and CosmoMC. In an appendix we document recent changes to CAMB's numerical treatment of massive neutrino perturbations, which are tested along with other recent improvements by our degeneracy exploration results.},

  abstract = {We investigate the peculiar motions of galaxies up to z = 0.5 using Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and predict the subsequent constraints on the growth rate of structure. We consider two cases. Our first is based on measurements of the volumetric SNe Ia rate and assumes we can obtain spectroscopic redshifts and light curves for varying fractions of objects that are detected pre-peak luminosity by LSST (some of which may be obtained by LSST itself, and others that would require additional follow-up observations). We find that these measurements could produce growth rate constraints at z{$<$} 0.5 that significantly outperform those found using Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) with DESI or 4MOST, even though there are ∼ 4× fewer objects. For our second case, we use semi-analytic simulations and a prescription for the SNe Ia rate as a function of stellar mass and star-formation rate to predict the number of LSST SNe IA whose host redshifts may already have been obtained with the Taipan+WALLABY surveys or with a future multi-object spectroscopic survey. We find ∼18,000 and ∼160,000 SNe Ia with host redshifts for these cases, respectively. While this is only a fraction of the total LSST-detected SNe Ia, they could be used to significantly augment and improve the growth rate constraints compared to only RSD. Ultimately, we find that combining LSST SNe Ia with large numbers of galaxy redshifts will provide the most powerful probe of large-scale gravity in the z{$<$} 0.5 regime over the coming decades.},

We revisit the idea of extracting this information by directly measuring the redshift-space momentum power spectrum from such surveys. We provide a comprehensive theoretical and practical framework for estimating and fitting this from data, analogous to well-understood techniques used to measure the galaxy density power spectrum from redshift surveys. We formally derive a new estimator, which includes the effects of shot noise and survey geometry; we evaluate the variance of the estimator in the Gaussian regime; we compute the optimal weights for the estimator; we demonstrate that the measurements are Gaussian distributed, allowing for easy extraction of cosmological parameters; and we explore the effects of peculiar velocity (PV) measurement errors. We finish with a proof-of-concept using realistic mock galaxy catalogues, which demonstrates that we can measure and fit both the redshift-space galaxy density and momentum power spectra from PV surveys and that including the latter substantially improves our constraints on the growth rate of structure. We also provide theoretical descriptions for modelling the non-linear redshift-space density and momentum power spectrum multipoles, and forecasting the constraints on cosmological parameters using the Fisher information contained in these measurements for arbitrary weights. These may be useful for measurements of the galaxy density power spectrum even in the absence of peculiar velocities.},

This \$7016\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{deg\}\^\{2\}\$ homogeneous sample comprises the largest set of PVs produced to date and extends the reach of PV surveys up to a redshift limit of z = 0.1. Our SDSS-based FP distance measurements have a mean uncertainty of 23 per cent. Alongside the data, we produce an ensemble of 2048 mock galaxy catalogues that reproduce the data selection function, and are used to validate our fitting pipelines and check for systematic errors. We uncover a significant trend between group richness and mean surface brightness within the sample, which may hint at an environmental dependence within the FP or the presence of unresolved systematics, and can result in biased PVs. This is removed by using multiple FP fits as function of group richness, a procedure made tractable through a new analytic derivation for the integral of a three-dimensional (3D) Gaussian over non-trivial limits. Our catalogue is calibrated to the zero-point of the CosmicFlows-III sample with an uncertainty of 0.004 dex (not including cosmic variance or the error within CosmicFlows-III itself), which is validated using independent cross-checks with the predicted zero-point from the 2M++ reconstruction of our local velocity field. Finally, as an example of what is possible with our new catalogue, we obtain preliminary bulk flow measurements up to a depth of \$135\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm h\}\^\{-1\}\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$. We find a slightly larger-than-expected bulk flow at high redshift, although this could be caused by the presence of the Shapley supercluster, which lies outside the SDSS PV footprint.},

  abstract = {We introduce a conceptually simple yet powerful analytic method which traces the structure of cosmic microwave background anisotropies to better than 5\%-10\% in temperature fluctuations on all scales. It is applicable to any model in which the gravitational potential is known and last scattering is sufficiently early. Moreover, it recovers and explains the presence of the 'Doppler peaks' at degree scales as driven acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon fluid. We treat in detail such subtleties as the time dependence of the gravitational driving force, anisotropic stress from the neutrino quadrupole, and damping during the recombination process, again all from an analytic standpoint. We apply this formalism to the standard cold dark matter model to gain physical insight into the anisotropies, including the dependence of the peak locations and heights on cosmological parameters such as Omegab and h. Furthermore, the ionization history controls damping due to the finite thickness of the last scattering surface, which is in fact mianly caused by photon diffusion. In addition to being a powerful probe into the nature of anisotropies, this treatment can be used in place of the standard Boltzmann code where 5\%-10\% accuracy in temperature fluctuations is satisfactory and/or speed is essential. Equally importantly, it can be used as a portable standard by which numerical codes can be tested and compared.},

Thomson scattering of temperature anisotropies on the last scattering surface generates a linear polarization pattern on the sky that can be simply read off from their quadrupole moments. These in turn correspond directly to the fundamental scalar (compressional), vector (vortical), and tensor (gravitational wave) modes of cosmological perturbations. We explain the origin and phenomenology of the geometric distinction between these patterns in terms of the so-called electric and magnetic parity modes, as well as their correlation with the temperature pattern. By its isolation of the last scattering surface and the various perturbation modes, the polarization provides unique information for the phenomenological reconstruction of the cosmological model. Finally we comment on the comparison of theory with experimental data and prospects for the future detection of CMB polarization.},

  abstract = {Large scale structure introduces two different kinds of errors in the luminosity distance estimates from standardizable candles such as supernovae Ia (SNe)—a Poissonian scatter for each SN and a coherent component due to correlated fluctuations between different SNe. Increasing the number of SNe helps reduce the first type of error but not the second. The coherent component has been largely ignored in forecasts of dark energy parameter estimation from upcoming SN surveys. For instance it is commonly thought, based on Poissonian considerations, that peculiar motion is unimportant, even for a low redshift SN survey such as the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory; z=0.03–0.08), which provides a useful anchor for future high redshift surveys by determining the SN zero point. We show that ignoring coherent peculiar motion leads to an underestimate of the zero-point error by about a factor of 2, despite the fact that SNfactory covers almost half of the sky. More generally, there are four types of fluctuations: peculiar motion, gravitational lensing, gravitational redshift and what is akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Peculiar motion and lensing dominates at low and high redshifts, respectively. Taking into account all significant luminosity distance fluctuations due to large scale structure leads to a degradation of up to 60\% in the determination of the dark energy equation of state from upcoming high redshift SN surveys, when used in conjunction with a low redshift anchor such as the SNfactory. The most relevant fluctuations are the coherent ones due to peculiar motion and the Poissonian ones due to lensing, with peculiar motion playing the dominant role. We also discuss to what extent the noise here can be viewed as a useful signal, and whether corrections can be made to reduce the degradation.},

It is applied to the study of photo-reionization models in which the amplitude, spectrum, and onset epoch of the ionizing flux, as well as the cosmology, are systematically varied. We find that the mean temperature-density relation at z = 2-4 is well approximated by a power-law equation of state for uniform reionization models. We derive analytical expressions for its evolution and exhibit its asymptotic behavior: it is found that, for sufficiently early reionization, imprints of reionization history prior to z = 10 on the temperature-density relation are washed out. While the amplitude of the radiation flux at the ionizing frequency of H I is found to have a negligible effect on the temperature-density relation as long as the universe reionizes before z = 5, the spectrum can change the overall temperature by about 20 percent, through variations in the abundances of helium species. However, the slope of the mean equation of state is found to lie within a narrow range for all reionization models we study, where reionization takes place before z = 5. We discuss the implications of these findings for the observational properties of the Ly-alpha forest.},

We present results from testing on early data from eBOSS, where we have found a 90.5\% automated redshift and spectral classification success rate for the luminous red galaxy sample (redshifts 0.6 ≲ z ≲ 1.0). The redmonster performance meets the eBOSS cosmology requirements for redshift classification and catastrophic failures and represents a significant improvement over the previous pipeline. We describe the empirical processes used to determine the optimum number of additive polynomial terms in our models and an acceptable \{\{Δ \}\}\{χ \}r2 threshold for declaring statistical confidence. Statistical errors on redshift measurement due to photon shot noise are assessed, and we find typical values of a few tens of km s-1. An investigation of redshift differences in repeat observations scaled by error estimates yields a distribution with a Gaussian mean and standard deviation of μ ˜ 0.01 and σ ˜ 0.65, respectively, suggesting the reported statistical redshift uncertainties are over-estimated by ˜54\%. We assess the effects of object magnitude, signal-to-noise ratio, fiber number, and fiber head location on the pipeline’s redshift success rate.

  abstract = {The quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatly accelerated in recent years, and further leaps forward will be facilitated by imminent projects. These will enable us to map the evolution of dark and baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these fluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to several pieces of fundamental physics: the primordial perturbations generated by GUT-scale physics; neutrino masses and interactions; the nature of dark matter and dark energy. We focus on the last of these here: the ways that combining probes of growth with those of the cosmic expansion such as distance-redshift relations will pin down the mechanism driving the acceleration of the Universe. One way to explain the acceleration of the Universe is invoke dark energy parameterized by an equation of state w. Distance measurements provide one set of constraints on w, but dark energy also affects how rapidly structure grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth of structure. Upcoming surveys are therefore designed to probe w with direct observations of the distance scale and the growth of structure, each complementing the other on systematic errors and constraints on dark energy. A consistent set of results will greatly increase the reliability of the final answer. Another possibility is that there is no dark energy, but that General Relativity does not describe the laws of physics accurately on large scales. While the properties of gravity have been measured with exquisite precision at stellar system scales and densities, within our solar system and by binary pulsar systems, its properties in different environments are poorly constrained. To fully understand if General Relativity is the complete theory of gravity we must test gravity across a spectrum of scales and densities. Rapid developments in gravitational wave astronomy and numerical relativity are directed at testing gravity in the high curvature, high density regime. Cosmological evolution provides a polar opposite test bed, probing how gravity behaves in the lowest curvature, low density environments. There are a number of different implementations of astrophysically relevant modifications of gravity. Generically, the models are able to reproduce the distance measurements while at the same time altering the growth of structure. In particular, as detailed below, the Poisson equation relating over-densities to gravitational potentials is altered, and the potential that determines the geodesics of relativistic particles (such as photons) differs from the potential that determines the motion of non-relativistic particles. Upcoming surveys will exploit these differences to determine whether the acceleration of the Universe is due to dark energy or to modified gravity. To realize this potential, both wide field imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects including DES, eBOSS, DESI, PFS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST are in line to map more than a 1000cubic-billion-light-year volume of the Universe. These will map the cosmic structure growth rate to 1\% in the redshift range 0},

Velocities introduce an additional guaranteed source of correlations between supernova magnitudes that should be considered in all analyses of nearby supernova samples but has largely been neglected in the past. Applying a likelihood analysis to the latest compilation of nearby supernovae, we find no evidence for the presence of these correlations, although, given the significant noise, the data is also consistent with the correlations predicted for the standard ΛCDM model. We then consider the dipolar component of the velocity correlations—the frequently studied ``bulk velocity''—and explicitly demonstrate that including the velocity correlations in the data covariance matrix is crucial for drawing correct and unambiguous conclusions about the bulk flow. In particular, current supernova data is consistent with no excess bulk flow on top of what is expected in ΛCDM and effectively captured by the covariance. We further clarify the nature of the apparent bulk flow that is inferred when the velocity covariance is ignored. We show that a significant fraction of this quantity is expected to be noise bias due to uncertainties in supernova magnitudes and not any physical peculiar motion.},

  abstract = {Peculiar velocities of objects in the nearby universe are correlated due to the gravitational pull of large-scale structure. By measuring these velocities, we have a unique opportunity to test the cosmological model at the lowest redshifts. We perform this test, using current data to constrain the amplitude of the ``signal'' covariance matrix describing the velocities and their correlations. We consider a new, well-calibrated ``Supercal'' set of low-redshift SNe Ia as well as a set of distances derived from the fundamental plane relation of 6dFGS galaxies. Analyzing the SN and galaxy data separately, both results are consistent with the peculiar velocity signal of our fiducial ΛCDM model, ruling out the noise-only model with zero peculiar velocities at greater than 7σ (SNe) and 8σ (galaxies). When the two data sets are combined appropriately, the precision of the test increases slightly, resulting in a constraint on the signal amplitude of A = 1.05-0.21+0.25, where A = 1 corresponds to our fiducial model. Equivalently, we report an 11\% measurement of the product of the growth rate and amplitude of mass fluctuations evaluated at zeff = 0.02, f σ8 = 0.428-0.045+0.048, valid for our fiducial ΛCDM model. We explore the robustness of the results to a number of conceivable variations in the analysis and find that individual variations shift the preferred signal amplitude by less than \textasciitilde 0.5σ. We briefly discuss our Supercal SN Ia results in comparison with our previous results using the JLA compilation.},

For the power spectra, this approach not only simplifies the calculations but is also readily generalized from the usual flat-sky approximation to the exact all-sky form by replacing Fourier harmonics with spherical harmonics. Counterintuitively, because of the nonlinear nature of the effect, errors in the flat-sky approximation do not improve on smaller scales. They remain at the 10\% level through the acoustic regime and are sufficiently large to merit adoption of the all-sky formalism. For the bispectra, a cosmic variance limited detection of the correlation with secondary anisotropies has an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise for combinations involving magnetic parity polarization than those involving the temperature alone. Detection of these bispectra will, however, be severely noise and foreground limited even with the Planck satellite, leaving room for improvement with higher sensitivity experiments. We also provide a general study of the correspondence between flat and all sky potentials, deflection angles, convergence and shear for the power spectra and bispectra.},

We introduce a Fisher matrix analysis of the information contained in weak lensing surveys to address these issues and provide a simple means of estimating how survey properties and source redshift uncertainties affect parameter measurement. We find that surveys on degree scales and above can improve the accuracy on parameters that affect the growth rate of structure by up to an order of magnitude compared to using the CMB alone even if the characteristic redshift of the sources must be determined from the data itself. Surprisingly, both sparse sampling and increasing the source redshift can weaken the cosmological constraints.},

  abstract = {We present a semi-analytic model for the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest that is inspired by the Halo Model. This model is built on the absorption line decomposition of the forest. Flux correlations are decomposed into those within each absorption line (the 1-absorber term) and those between separate lines (the 2-absorber term), treating the lines as biased tracers of the underlying matter fluctuations. While the nonlinear exponential mapping between optical depth and flux requires an infinite series of moments to calculate any statistic, we show that this series can be re-summed (truncating at the desired order in the linear matter overdensity). We focus on the z=2-3 line-of-sight power spectrum. Our model finds that 1-absorber term dominates the power on all scales, with most of its contribution coming from H I columns of 10\textsuperscript{14}-10\textsuperscript{15} cm\textsuperscript{-2}, while the smaller 2-absorber contribution comes from lower columns that trace overdensities of a few. The prominence of the 1-absorber correlations indicates that the line-of-sight power spectrum is shaped principally by the lines' number densities and their absorption profiles, with correlations between lines contributing to a lesser extent. We present intuitive formulae for the effective optical depth as well as the large-scale limits of 1-absorber and 2-absorber terms, which simplify to integrals over the H I column density distribution with different equivalent-width weightings. With minimalist models for the bias of absorption systems and their peculiar velocity broadening, our model predicts values for the density bias and velocity gradient bias that are consistent with those found in simulations. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Lyman-\$\textbackslash beta\$ forest refers to a region in the spectra of distant quasars that lies between the rest-frame Lyman-\$\textbackslash beta\$ and Lyman-\$\textbackslash gamma\$ emissions. The forest in this region is dominated by a combination of absorption due to resonant Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ and Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ scattering. When considering the 1D Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ forest in addition to the 1D Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest, the full statistical description of the data requires four 1D power spectra: Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ and Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ auto-power spectra and the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$-Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ real and imaginary cross-power spectra. We describe how these can be measured using an optimal quadratic estimator that naturally disentangles Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ and Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ contributions. Using a sample of approximately 60,000 quasar sight-lines from the BOSS Data Release 9, we make the measurement of the one-dimensional power spectrum of fluctuations due to the Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ resonant scattering. While we have not corrected our measurements for resolution damping of the power and other systematic effects carefully enough to use them for cosmological constraints, we can robustly conclude the following: i) Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ power spectrum and Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$-Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ cross spectra are detected with high statistical significance; ii) the cross-correlation coefficient is \$\textbackslash approx 1\$ on large scales; iii) the Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ measurements are contaminated by the associated OVI absorption, which is analogous to the SiIII contamination of the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest. Measurements of the Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ forest will allow extension of the usable path-length for the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ measurements while allowing a better understanding of the physics of intergalactic medium and thus more robust cosmological constraints.},

Even though several studies exist on relativistic effects in galaxy clustering, this is the first study to extend the formalism to a different tracer of underlying matter at unique redshift range (z=2-5). Furthermore, we show a comprehensive application of our calculations to the Quasar-Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation function. Our results indicate that the signal of relativistic effects are sizeable at Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale mainly due to the large differences in density bias factors of our tracers. We construct an observable, the anti-symmetric part of the cross-correlation function, that is dominated by the relativistic signal and offers a new way to measure the relativistic terms at relatively small scales. The analysis shows that relativistic effects are important when considering cross-correlations between tracers with very different biases, and should be included in the data analysis of the current and future surveys. Moreover, the idea presented in this paper is highly complementary to other techniques and observables trying to isolate the effect of the relativistic corrections and thus test the validity of the theory of gravity beyond the Newtonian regime. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

However, with the advent of precision cosmology, it has also become a well-motivated endeavor by itself to test gravitational physics at cosmic scales. We overview cosmological probes of gravity, formalisms and parameterizations for testing deviations from GR at cosmological scales, selected modified gravity (MG) theories, gravitational screening mechanisms, and computer codes developed for these tests. We then provide summaries of recent cosmological constraints on MG parameters and selected MG models. We supplement these cosmological constraints with a summary of implications from the recent binary neutron star merger event. Next, we summarize some results on MG parameter forecasts with and without astrophysical systematics that will dominate the uncertainties. The review aims at providing an overall picture of the subject and an entry point to students and researchers interested in joining the field. It can also serve as a quick reference to recent results and constraints on testing gravity at cosmological scales.},

  abstract = {Context. Scaling properties of galaxy cluster observables with cluster mass provide central insights into the processes shaping clusters. Calibrating proxies for cluster mass that are relatively cheap to observe will moreover be crucial to harvest the cosmological information available from the number and growth of clusters with upcoming surveys like eROSITA and Euclid. The recent Planck results led to suggestions that X-ray masses might be biased low by \textasciitilde 40\%, more than previously considered. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We aim to extend knowledge of the weak lensing - X-ray mass scaling towards lower masses (as low as 1 × 10\textsuperscript{14}M\textsubscript{☉}) in a sample representative of the z \textasciitilde{} 0.4-0.5 population. Thus, we extend the direct calibration of cluster mass estimates to higher redshifts. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We investigate the scaling behaviour of MMT/Megacam weak lensing (WL) masses for 8 clusters at 0.39 ≤ z ≤ 0.80 as part of the 400d WL programme with hydrostatic Chandra X-ray masses as well as those based on the proxies, e.g. Y\textsubscript{X} = T\textsubscript{X}M\textsubscript{gas}. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Overall, we find good agreement between WL and X-ray masses, with different mass bias estimators all consistent with zero. When subdividing the sample into a low-mass and a high-mass subsample, we find the high-mass subsample to show no significant mass bias while for the low-mass subsample, there is a bias towards overestimated X-ray masses at the \textasciitilde 2σ level for some mass proxies. The overall scatter in the mass-mass scaling relations is surprisingly low. Investigating possible causes, we find that neither the greater range in WL than in X-ray masses nor the small scatter can be traced back to the parameter settings in the WL analysis. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: We do not find evidence for a strong (\textasciitilde 40\%) underestimate in the X-ray masses, as suggested to reconcile recent Planck cluster counts and cosmological constraints. For high-mass clusters, our measurements are consistent with other studies in the literature. The mass dependent bias, significant at \textasciitilde 2σ, may hint at a physically different cluster population (less relaxed clusters with more substructure and mergers); or it may be due to small number statistics. Further studies of low-mass high-z lensing clusters will elucidate their mass scaling behaviour. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201322870/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}},

We show how this problem can be mitigated using a new observable, \$Q\_0\$, which can be easily estimated from the redshift space clustering data and is approximately equal to the real space power spectrum. The new statistic does not suffer from fingers of God and can be accurately described with perturbation theory down to \$k\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\textbackslash simeq 0.4\textasciitilde h\textasciitilde\textbackslash text\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. It can be straightforwardly included in the likelihood at negligible additional computational cost, and yields noticeable improvements on cosmological parameters compared to standard power spectrum multipole analyses.

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter measurements from the publicly available Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data on anisotropic galaxy clustering in Fourier space. Compared to previous studies, our analysis has two main novel features. First, we use a complete perturbation theory model that properly takes into account the non-linear effects of dark matter clustering, short-scale physics, galaxy bias, redshift-space distortions, and large-scale bulk flows. Second, we employ a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique and consistently reevaluate the full power spectrum likelihood as we scan over different cosmologies. Our baseline analysis assumes minimal ΛCDM, varies the neutrino masses within a reasonably tight range, fixes the primordial power spectrum tilt, and uses the big bang nucleosynthesis prior on the physical baryon density ωb. In this setup, we find the following late-Universe parameters: Hubble constant H0=(67.9± 1.1) km s-1Mpc-1, matter density fraction Ωm=0.295± 0.010, and the mass fluctuation amplitude σ8=0.721± 0.043. These parameters were measured directly from the BOSS data and independently of the Planck cosmic microwave background observations. Scanning over the power spectrum tilt or relaxing the other priors do not significantly alter our main conclusions. Finally, we discuss the information content of the BOSS power spectrum and show that it is dominated by the location of the baryon acoustic oscillations and the power spectrum shape. We argue that the contribution of the Alcock-Paczynski effect is marginal in ΛCDM, but becomes important for non-minimal cosmological models.},

  abstract = {We study if the discrepancy between the local and cosmological measurements of the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$ can be reformulated as a tension in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) monopole temperature \$T\_0\$. The latter is customarily fixed to the FIRAS best-fit value in CMB data analyses. Although this value was confirmed by several independent experiments, it is interesting to see how much parameter constraints depend on this prior. We first provide a detailed pedagogical description of the \$T\_0\$ effects on cosmological observables. We show that the recombination history and transfer functions do not depend on \$T\_0\$, provided they are parametrized by the energy scale rather than redshift, and at fixed dark matter and baryon densities per CMB photon. Thus, \$T\_0\$ is only a property of the observer, quantifying the amount of expansion between key cosmological events and today. As a consequence, the sole effect of \$T\_0\$ on small-scale primary CMB anisotropies is through the angular diameter distance to the epoch of last scattering, resulting in a near-perfect degeneracy between \$T\_0\$ and \$H\_0\$. This geometric degeneracy is partially lifted by the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and CMB lensing. Still, Planck data alone is consistent with a broad region in the \$H\_0-T\_0\$ plane, implying that removing the FIRAS prior on \$T\_0\$ can make Planck and SH0ES less discrepant, without introducing new physics beyond \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM. One may break the degeneracy by combining Planck with SH0ES, yielding an independent measurement of \$T\_0\$, which happens to be in \$3\textbackslash sigma\$ tension with FIRAS. Therefore, the Hubble tension indeed can be recast into the \$T\_0\$ tension. The agreement with FIRAS is restored when combining Planck with the baryon acoustic oscillation data instead of SH0ES. Thus, the tension between SH0ES and cosmological measurements of \$H\_0\$ persists even if we discard the FIRAS \$T\_0\$ prior.},

Possibility of composite spectra utilization in these fields is related to remarkable similarity of quasar spectra in UV-optical range. But despite of general similarity in spectral shapes, they differ in several parameters, one of which is the spectral index. In this paper, we study the possible effects related to neglect of this difference. We compiled 16 composite spectra from subsamples of individual Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 quasar spectra with different spectral indices $\alpha$λ within the wavelength range 1270-1480 Å. Using them we show that (i) the uncertainties of redshifts measured for a test sample of high signal-to-noise ratio quasar spectra using these composites as templates appear to be 1.5 times smaller than of those calculated with a traditional template, compiled from spectra with different $\alpha$λ; (ii) the difference in $\alpha$λ in individual spectra used for compilation of composites can yield the mean transmission uncertainty up to 20 per cent; (iii) a number of emission lines indistinguishable in ordinary composites, but seen in individual high-resolution spectra, can be detected in such composites. It is also shown that there is no dependence of $\alpha$λ on quasar luminosity in SDSS u, g, r and i bands, and monochromatic luminosity at 1450 Å.},

The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky that is visible from Cerro Pachon in Northern Chile. The current baseline design, with an 8.4m (6.5m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 sq. deg. field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera, will allow about 10,000 sq.deg. of sky to be covered using pairs of 15-second exposures twice per night every three nights on average, with typical 5-sigma depth for point sources of r=24.5. The system is designed to yield high image quality as well as superb astrometric and photometric accuracy. The total survey area will include 30,000 sq.deg. with delta{$<$}+34.5, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, ugrizy, covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is scheduled to begin the regular survey operations before the end of this decade. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 sq.deg. region about 1000 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to r=27.5. These data will result in databases including 10 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and will serve the majority of science programs. (abridged)},

  abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 field of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six filters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r ∼ 27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

  abstract = {Weak lensing by large-scale structure induces correlated ellipticities in the images of distant galaxies. The two-point correlation is determined by the matter power spectrum along the line of sight. We use the fully nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum to compute the predicted ellipticity correlation. We present results for different measures of the second moment for angular scales θ \textasciitilde = 1'-3° and for alternative normalizations of the power spectrum, in order to explore the best strategy for constraining the cosmological parameters. Normalizing to observed cluster abundance, the rms amplitude of ellipticity within a 15' radius is \textasciitilde =0.01z0.6s, almost independent of the cosmological model, with zs being the median redshift of background galaxies. Nonlinear effects in the evolution of the power spectrum significantly enhance the ellipticity for θ {$<$} 10'--for θ \textasciitilde = 1' the rms ellipticity is \textasciitilde =0.05, which is nearly twice as large as the linear prediction. This enhancement means that the signal-to-noise ratio for the ellipticity is only weakly increasing with angle for 2' {$<$} θ {$<$} 2°, unlike the expectation from linear theory that the signal-to-noise ratio is strongly peaked on degree scales. The scaling with cosmological parameters also changes because of nonlinear effects. By measuring the correlations on small (nonlinear) and large (linear) angular scales, different cosmological parameters can be independently constrained to obtain a model-independent estimate of both power spectrum amplitude and matter density Ωm. Nonlinear effects also modify the probability distribution of the ellipticity. Using second-order perturbation theory, we find that over most of the range of interest there are significant deviations from a normal distribution.},

The sum of these surveys has the potential to be significantly greater than the contributions of the individual parts. As is detailed in this report, the combination of these surveys should give us multi-wavelength high-resolution images of galaxies and broadband data covering much of the stellar energy spectrum. These stellar and galactic data have the potential of yielding new insights into topics ranging from the formation history of the Milky Way to the mass of the neutrino. However, enabling the astronomy community to fully exploit this multi-instrument data set is a challenging technical task: for much of the science, we will need to combine the photometry across multiple wavelengths with varying spectral and spatial resolution. We identify some of the key science enabled by the combined surveys and the key technical challenges in achieving the synergies.},

  abstract = {Despite the utility of neural networks (NNs) for astronomical time-series classification, the proliferation of learning architectures applied to diverse datasets has thus far hampered a direct intercomparison of different approaches. Here we perform the first comprehensive study of variants of NN-based learning and inference for astronomical time-series, aiming to provide the community with an overview on relative performance and, hopefully, a set of best-in-class choices for practical implementations. In both supervised and self-supervised contexts, we study the effects of different time-series-compatible layer choices, namely the dilated temporal convolutional neural network (dTCNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) NNs, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and temporal convolutional NNs (tCNNs). We also study the efficacy and performance of encoder-decoder (i.e., autoencoder) networks compared to direct classification networks, different pathways to include auxiliary (non-time-series) metadata, and different approaches to incorporate multi-passband data (i.e., multiple time-series per source). Performance---applied to a sample of 17,604 variable stars from the MACHO survey across 10 imbalanced classes---is measured in training convergence time, classification accuracy, reconstruction error, and generated latent variables. We find that networks with Recurrent NN (RNNs) generally outperform dTCNs and, in many scenarios, yield to similar accuracy as tCNNs. In learning time and memory requirements, convolution-based layers are more performant. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations of deep architectures for variable star classification, with a particular eye towards next-generation surveys such as LSST, WFIRST and ZTF2.},

  abstract = {We build a field level emulator for cosmic structure formation that is accurate in the nonlinear regime. Our emulator consists of two convolutional neural networks trained to output the nonlinear displacements and velocities of N-body simulation particles based on their linear inputs. Cosmology dependence is encoded in the form of style parameters at each layer of the neural network, enabling the emulator to effectively interpolate the outcomes of structure formation between different flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmologies over a wide range of background matter densities. The neural network architecture makes the model differentiable by construction, providing a powerful tool for fast field level inference. We test the accuracy of our method by considering several summary statistics, including the density power spectrum with and without redshift space distortions, the displacement power spectrum, the momentum power spectrum, the density bispectrum, halo abundances, and halo profiles with and without redshift space distortions. We compare these statistics from our emulator with the full N-body results, the COLA method, and a fiducial neural network with no cosmological dependence. We find our emulator gives accurate results down to scales of \$k \textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, h\$, representing a considerable improvement over both COLA and the fiducial neural network. We also demonstrate that our emulator generalizes well to initial conditions containing primordial non-Gaussianity, without the need for any additional style parameters or retraining.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new and efficient Bayesian method for non-linear three-dimensional large-scale structure inference. We employ a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler to obtain samples from a multivariate highly non-Gaussian lognormal Poissonian density posterior given a set of observations. The HMC allows us to take into account the non-linear relations between the observations and the underlying density field which we seek to recover. As the HMC provides a sampled representation of the density posterior any desired statistical summary, such as the mean, mode or variance, can be calculated from the set of samples. Further, it permits us to seamlessly propagate non-Gaussian uncertainty information to any final quantity inferred from the set of samples. The developed method is extensively tested in a variety of test scenarios, taking into account a highly structured survey geometry and selection effects. Tests with a mock galaxy catalogue based on the Millennium Run show that the method is able to recover the filamentary structure of the non-linear density field. The results further demonstrate the feasibility of non-Gaussian sampling in high-dimensional spaces, as required for precision non-linear large-scale structure inference. The HMC is a flexible and efficient method, which permits for simple extension and incorporation of additional observational constraints. Thus, the method presented here provides an efficient and flexible basis for future high-precision large-scale structure inference.},

  abstract = {We derive and implement a full Bayesian large scale structure inference method aiming at precision recovery of the cosmological power spectrum from galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach improves upon previous Bayesian methods by performing a joint inference of the three-dimensional density field, the cosmological power spectrum, luminosity dependent galaxy biases, and corresponding normalizations. We account for all joint and correlated uncertainties between all inferred quantities. Classes of galaxies with different biases are treated as separate subsamples. This method therefore also allows the combined analysis of more than one galaxy survey. In particular, it solves the problem of inferring the power spectrum from galaxy surveys with non-trivial survey geometries by exploring the joint posterior distribution with efficient implementations of multiple block Markov chain and Hybrid Monte Carlo methods. Our Markov sampler achieves high statistical efficiency in low signal-to-noise regimes by using a deterministic reversible jump algorithm. This approach reduces the correlation length of the sampler by several orders of magnitude, turning the otherwise numerically unfeasible problem of joint parameter exploration into a numerically manageable task. We test our method on an artificial mock galaxy survey, emulating characteristic features of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7, such as its survey geometry and luminosity-dependent biases. These tests demonstrate the numerical feasibility of our large scale Bayesian inference frame work when the parameter space has millions of dimensions. This method reveals and correctly treats the anti-correlation between bias amplitudes and power spectrum, which are not taken into account in current approaches to power spectrum estimation, a 20\% effect across large ranges in k space. In addition, this method results in constrained realizations of density fields obtained without assuming the power spectrum or bias parameters in advance.},

  abstract = {Accurate analyses of present and next-generation galaxy surveys require new ways to handle effects of non-linear gravitational structure formation in data. To address these needs we present an extension of our previously developed algorithm for Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies to analyse matter clustering at non-linear scales in observations. This is achieved by incorporating a numerical particle mesh model of structure formation into our Bayesian inference framework. The algorithm simultaneously infers the 3D primordial matter fluctuations from which present non-linear observations formed and provides reconstructions of velocity fields and structure formation histories. The physical forward modelling approach automatically accounts for non-Gaussian features in evolved matter density fields and addresses the redshift space distortion problem associated with peculiar motions of galaxies. Our algorithm employs a hierarchical Bayes approach to jointly account for observational effects, such as galaxy biases, selection effects, and noise. Corresponding parameters are marginalized out via a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach relying on a combination of a multiple block sampling framework and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. We demonstrate the performance of the method by applying it to the 2M++ galaxy compilation, tracing the matter distribution of the Nearby Universe. We show accurate and detailed inferences of the 3D non-linear dark matter distribution of the Nearby Universe. As exemplified in the case of the Coma cluster, we provide mass estimates that are compatible with those obtained from weak lensing and X-ray observations. For the first time, we reconstruct the vorticity of the non-linear velocity field from observations. In summary, our method provides plausible and detailed inferences of dark matter and velocity fields of our cosmic neighbourhood.},

  abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation techniques that robustly account for  systematic measurement uncertainties will be crucial for the next generation of cosmological surveys. We present a new analysis method, superABC, for obtaining cosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) without any likelihood assumptions. The ABC method works by using a forward model simulation of the data where systematic uncertainties can be simulated and marginalized over. A key feature of the method presented here is the use of two distinct metrics, the `Tripp' and `Light Curve' metrics, which allow us to compare the simulated data to the observed data set. The Tripp metric takes as input the parameters of models fit to each light curve with the SALT-II method, whereas the Light Curve metric uses the measured fluxes directly without model fitting. We apply the superABC sampler to a simulated data set of \$\textbackslash sim\$1000 SNe corresponding to the first season of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Varying \$\textbackslash Omega\_m, w\_0, \textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash beta\$ and a magnitude offset parameter, with no systematics we obtain \$\textbackslash Delta(w\_0) = w\_0\^\{\textbackslash rm true\} - w\_0\^\{\textbackslash rm best \textbackslash, fit\} = -0.036\textbackslash pm0.109\$ (a \$\textbackslash sim11\$\% 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainty) using the Tripp metric and \$\textbackslash Delta(w\_0) = -0.055\textbackslash pm0.068\$ (a \$\textbackslash sim7\$\% 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainty) using the Light Curve metric. Including 1\% calibration uncertainties in four passbands, adding 4 more parameters, we obtain \$\textbackslash Delta(w\_0) = -0.062\textbackslash pm0.132\$ (a \$\textbackslash sim14\$\% 1\$\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainty) using the Tripp metric. Overall we find a \$17\$\% increase in the uncertainty on \$w\_0\$ with systematics compared to without. We contrast this with a MCMC approach where systematic effects are approximately included. We find that the MCMC method slightly underestimates the impact of calibration uncertainties for this simulated data set.},

  abstract = {The non-linear, scale-dependent bias in the mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying dark matter is a key systematic affecting the extraction of cosmological parameters from galaxy clustering. Using 95 million haloes from the Millennium-XXL N-body simulation, we find that the mass bias is scale independent only for k~\&lt;~0.1\,h\,Mpc−1 today (z~=~0) and for k~\&lt;~0.2\,h\,Mpc−1 at z~=~0.7. We test analytic halo bias models against our simulation measurements and find that the model of Tinker et~al. is accurate to better than 5\,per\,cent at z~=~0. However, the simulation results are better fitted by an ellipsoidal collapse model at z~=~0.7. We highlight, for the first time, another potentially serious systematic due to a sampling bias in the halo velocity divergence power spectra which will affect the comparison between observations and any redshift-space distortion model which assumes dark matter velocity statistics with no velocity bias. By measuring the velocity divergence power spectra for different sized halo samples, we find that there is a significant bias which increases with decreasing number density. This bias is approximately 20\,per\,cent at k~=~0.1\,h~Mpc−1 for a halo sample of number density \$\textbackslash bar\{n\} = 10\^\{-3\} (h/\$~Mpc)3 at both z~=~0 and 0.7 for the velocity divergence auto power spectrum. Given the importance of redshift-space distortions as a probe of dark energy and the major ongoing effort to advance models for the clustering signal in redshift space, our results show that this velocity bias introduces another systematic, alongside scale-dependent halo mass bias, which cannot be neglected.},

  abstract = {One of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (EoR) is through radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutral hydrogen. These observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping of redshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities of the gas. Such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properly understood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics. We study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of 21-cm radiation from the EoR using large scale \$N\$-body and radiative transfer simulations. We quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrum by redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionization progresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. We go on to study the effects of redshift space distortions on LOFAR observations, taking instrument noise and foreground subtraction into account. We find that LOFAR should be able to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift space distortions at spatial scales around \$k \textbackslash sim 0.1\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ after \$\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 1000 hours of integration time. At larger scales, sample errors become a limiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds make the extraction of the signal problematic. Finally, we show how the astrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from LOFAR observations, and how it can be used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.},

After filtering the spectra to mitigate selection effects and Malmquist bias associated with a nearly flux-limited sample, we create high signal-to-noise ratio composite spectra from 58,656 quasars (2.1≤slant z≤slant 3.5), binned by luminosity, spectral index, and redshift. With these composite spectra, we confirm the traditional Baldwin effect (BE, I.e., the anti-correlation of C IV equivalent width (EW) and luminosity) that follows the relation \{W\}λ \textbackslash propto \{L\}\{β w\} with slope \{β \}w=-0.35+/- 0.004, -0.35 ± 0.005, and -0.41 ± 0.005 for z = 2.25, 2.46, and 2.84, respectively. In addition to the redshift evolution in the slope of the BE, we find redshift evolution in average quasar spectral features at fixed luminosity. The spectroscopic signature of the redshift evolution is correlated at 98\% with the signature of varying luminosity, indicating that they arise from the same physical mechanism. At a fixed luminosity, the average C IV FWHM decreases with increasing redshift and is anti-correlated with C IV EW. The spectroscopic signature associated with C IV FWHM suggests that the trends in luminosity and redshift are likely caused by a superposition of effects that are related to black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The redshift evolution is the consequence of a changing balance between these two quantities as quasars evolve toward a population with lower typical accretion rates at a given black hole mass.},

After optimizing its performance for the usage in likelihood expressions, the shrinkage estimator yields subdominant bias and variance comparable to that of the standard estimator with a factor of ∼50 less realizations. This is achieved without any prior information on the properties of the data or the structure of the covariance matrix, at a negligible computational cost.},

Though most Pan-STARRS SNe lack spectroscopic classifications, in a previous paper we demonstrated that photometrically classified SNe can be used to infer unbiased cosmological parameters by using a Bayesian methodology that marginalizes over core-collapse (CC) SN contamination. Our sample contains nearly twice as many SNe as the largest previous SN Ia compilation. Combining SNe with cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints from Planck, we measure the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w to be -0.989 ± 0.057 (stat+sys). If w evolves with redshift as w(a) = w 0 + w a (1 - a), we find w 0 = -0.912 ± 0.149 and w a = -0.513 ± 0.826. These results are consistent with cosmological parameters from the Joint Light-curve Analysis and the Pantheon sample. We try four different photometric classification priors for Pan-STARRS SNe and two alternate ways of modeling CC SN contamination, finding that no variant gives a w differing by more than 2\% from the baseline measurement. The systematic uncertainty on w due to marginalizing over CC SN contamination, \{σ \}wCC\vphantom\{\}=0.012, is the third-smallest source of systematic uncertainty in this work. We find limited (1.6σ) evidence for evolution of the SN color-luminosity relation with redshift, a possible systematic that could constitute a significant uncertainty in future high-z analyses. Our data provide one of the best current constraints on w, demonstrating that samples with ∼5\% CC SN contamination can give competitive cosmological constraints when the contaminating distribution is marginalized over in a Bayesian framework.},

  abstract = {We analyze the two-point statistics of the gravitationally induced ellipticities of distant galaxy images which provide a direct probe of the mass fluctuation spectrum P(k). The analysis extends previous work in the following respects: (1) We explore the relation between the ellipticity pattern of the background galaxies and the projected density of foreground matter. This yields both useful statistical correlations and also an approximate method for directly imaging foreground mass concentrations. (2) We calculate angular power spectra, using the analogue of Limber's equation in the Fourier domain, as well as angular correlation functions. We find that there are some characteristic features of the ellipticity correlations that appear most clearly in the Fourier representation. (3) The analysis is valid for arbitrary evolution of P(k) and for an arbitrary distance distribution for the galaxies. We show that the size of the effect on very large scales is tightly constrained by microwave anisotropy limits, but that the density fluctuations inferred from observed peculiar motions suggest interestingly large effects at angular scales below about a degree. We compute angular power spectra and correlation functions for a number of illustrative models for P(k). We discuss methods for estimating the various statistics, estimate their statistical uncertainty, and discuss the feasibility of this test.},

  abstract = {We explore the dependence of weak lensing phenomena on the background cosmology. We first generalize the relation between P\textsubscript{ψ}(ω), the angular power spectrum of the distortion, and the power spectrum of density fluctuations to nonflat cosmologies. We then compute P\textsubscript{ψ} for various illustrative models. A useful cosmological discriminator is the growth of P\textsubscript{ψ} with source redshift, which is much stronger in low-matter density models and especially in Λ-dominated models. With even crude redshift information (say from broadband colors), it should be possible to constrain the cosmological world model. The amplitude of P\textsubscript{ψ}(ω) is also quite sensitive to the cosmology, but requires a reliable external normalization for the mass fluctuations. If one normalizes to galaxy clustering, with M/L fixed by small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low-density models predict a much stronger distortion. If, however, one normalizes to large-scale bulk flows, the predicted distortion for sources at redshifts Z\textsubscript{s} \textasciitilde{} 1-3 is rather insensitive to the background cosmology. The signals predicted here can be detected at a very high level of significance with a photometric survey covering, say, 10 deg\textsuperscript{2}, but sparse sampling is needed to avoid large sampling variance. We discuss the factors influencing the design of an optimum survey. Turning to weak lensing by clusters, we find that for high lens redshifts (Z\textsubscript{l} \textasciitilde = 1) the critical density is substantially reduced in Λ-models, but that the ratio of the shear or convergence to the velocity dispersions or X-ray temperature of clusters is only very weakly dependent on the cosmology.},

We apply this to the BOSS CMASS sample, to see if it removes the excess power previously observed beyond the best-fitting ΛCDM model on very large scales. We consider several possible sources of data contamination, and check whether they affect the number of targets that can be observed and the power spectrum measurements. We describe a general framework for how such knowledge can be transformed into template fields. Mode subtraction can then be used to remove these systematic contaminants at least as well as applying corrective weighting to the observed galaxies, but benefits from giving an unbiased power. Even after applying templates for all known systematics, we find a large-scale power excess, but this is reduced compared with that observed using the weights provided by the BOSS team. This excess is at much larger scales than the BAO scale and does not affect the main results of BOSS. However, it will be important for the measurement of a scale-dependent bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. The excess is beyond that allowed by any simple model of non-Gaussianity matching Planck data, and is not matched in other surveys. We show that this power excess can further be reduced but is still present using `phenomenological' templates, designed to consider further potentially unknown sources of systematic contamination. As all discrepant angular modes can be removed using `phenomenological' templates, the potentially remaining contaminant acts radially.},

We separate the process into three separate stages: (I) removing the contaminant signal, (II) estimating the uncontaminated cosmological power spectrum and (III) debiasing the resulting estimates. For (I), we show that removing the best-fitting contaminant (mode subtraction) and setting the contaminated components of the covariance to be infinite (mode deprojection) are mathematically equivalent. For (II), performing a quadratic maximum likelihood (QML) estimate after mode deprojection gives an optimal unbiased solution, although it requires the manipulation of large N\_mode\^2 matrices (N\textsubscript{mode} being the total number of modes), which is unfeasible for recent 3D galaxy surveys. Measuring a binned average of the modes for (II) as proposed by Feldman, Kaiser \&amp; Peacock (FKP) is faster and simpler, but is sub-optimal and gives rise to a biased solution. We present a method to debias the resulting FKP measurements that does not require any large matrix calculations. We argue that the sub-optimality of the FKP estimator compared with the QML estimator, caused by contaminants, is less severe than that commonly ignored due to the survey window.},

Modeling the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth with a power law, τeff = τ0(1+z)γ, produces τ0=(5.54 ± 0.64)× 10-3 and γ =3.182± 0.074. The 2.2\% precision estimate on γ is dominated by systematic errors, likely arising from the bias and uncertainties in spectral index estimates. Even after incorporating the systematic errors, this work provides the most precise estimates of optical depth parameters to date. Finally, using the reconstructed Ly$\alpha$ forest continuum to directly measure the transmitted flux ratio as a function of redshift, we find deviations of less than 2.5\% from the predictions from the global model and no convincing evidence for signal associated with He II reionization.},

In this work, we revisit the optimal quadratic estimator for \$P\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{1D\}\}\$, which is robust against the relevant problems such as pixel masking, time evolution within spectrum and quasar continuum errors. We further improve the estimator by introducing a fiducial power spectrum, which enables us to extract more information by alleviating the discreteness of band powers. We meticulously apply our method to synthetic DESI spectra and demonstrate how the estimator overcomes each challenge. We further apply an optimisation scheme that approximates the Fisher matrix to three elements per row and reduces computation time by 60\%. We show that we can achieve percent precision in \$P\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{1D\}\}\$ with 5-year DESI data in the absence of systematics and provide forecasts for different spectral qualities.},

  abstract = {Slice Sampling has emerged as a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that adapts to the characteristics of the target distribution with minimal hand-tuning. However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter and the method generally struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions. This paper introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling (ESS), a new class of algorithms that bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the initial length scale and utilising an ensemble of parallel walkers in order to efficiently handle strong correlations between parameters. These affine-invariant algorithms are trivial to construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional MCMC methods on a broad range of highly correlated target distributions. In cases of strongly multimodal target distributions, Ensemble Slice Sampling can sample efficiently even in high dimensions. We argue that the parallel, black-box and gradient-free nature of the method renders it ideal for use in scientific fields such as physics, astrophysics and cosmology which are dominated by a wide variety of computationally expensive and non-differentiable models.},

Although the five models differ in their cosmological parameters and in the shapes and amplitudes of their mass power spectra, they predict remarkably similar galaxy clustering at z=2, 3, and 4. The galaxy correlation functions show almost no evolution over this redshift range, even though the mass correlation functions grow steadily in time. Despite the fairly low circular velocity threshold of the simulations, the high-redshift galaxies are usually highly biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution; the bias factor evolves with redshift and varies from model to model. Predicted correlation lengths for the resolved galaxy population are 2-3 h-1 Mpc (comoving) at z=3. More massive galaxies tend to be more strongly clustered. These CDM models have no difficulty in explaining the strong observed clustering of Lyman-break galaxies, and some may even predict excessive clustering. Because the effects of bias obscure differences in mass clustering, it appears that Lyman-break galaxy clustering will not be a good test of cosmological models but will instead provide a tool for constraining the physics of galaxy formation.},

Damped absorbers are typically \textasciitilde 10 kpc in radius, but the population has a large total cross section because the systems are much more numerous than present-day L* galaxies.

Central to this model is the notion of MHD winds launched from the accretion disks that power these objects. These winds provide the matter that manifests as blueshifted absorption features in the UV and X-ray spectra of a large fraction of these sources; furthermore, their density distribution in the poloidal plane determines the "appearance" (i.e. the column and velocity structure of these absorption features) as a function of the observer inclination angle. This work focuses on just the broadest characteristics of these objects; nonetheless, it provides scaling laws that allow one to reproduce within this model the properties of objects spanning a very wide luminosity range and viewed at different inclination angles, and trace them to a common underlying dynamical structure. Its general conclusion is that the AGN phenomenology can be accounted for in terms of three parameters: The wind mass flux in units of the Eddington value, m*, the observer's inclination angle θ and the logarithmic slope between the O/UV and X-ray fluxes ?OX. However, because of a significant correlation between ?OX and UV luminosity, we conclude that the AGN structure depends on only two parameters. Interestingly, the correlations implied by this model appear to extend to and consistent with the characteristics of galactic X-ray sources, suggesting the presence of a truly unified underlying structure for accretion powered sources.},

We show using both data and simulations that the reconstruction technique can often be effective despite patchiness of the survey, significant edge effects and shot-noise. We investigate three redshift bins in the redshift range 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 1, and in all three find improvement after reconstruction in the detection of the baryonic acoustic feature and its usage as a standard ruler. We measure model-independent distance measures DV(rsfid/rs) of 1716 ± 83, 2221 ± 101, 2516 ± 86 Mpc (68 per cent CL) at effective redshifts z = 0.44, 0.6, 0.73, respectively, where DV is the volume-averaged distance, and rs is the sound horizon at the end of the baryon drag epoch. These significantly improved 4.8, 4.5 and 3.4 per cent accuracy measurements are equivalent to those expected from surveys with up to 2.5 times the volume of WiggleZ without reconstruction applied. These measurements are fully consistent with cosmologies allowed by the analyses of the Planck Collaboration and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We provide the DV(rsfid/rs) posterior probability distributions and their covariances. When combining these measurements with temperature fluctuations measurements of Planck, the polarization of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 9, and the 6dF Galaxy Survey baryonic acoustic feature, we do not detect deviations from a flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model. Assuming this model, we constrain the current expansion rate to H0 = 67.15 ± 0.98 km s-1Mpc-1. Allowing the equation of state of dark energy to vary, we obtain wDE = -1.080 ± 0.135.

  abstract = {We present empirical scaling relations for the significance of absorption features detected in medium-resolution, far-UV spectra obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). These relations properly account for both the extended wings of the COS line-spread function and the non-Poissonian noise properties of the data, which we characterize for the first time, and predict limiting equivalent widths that deviate from the empirical behavior by ≤ 5\% when the wavelength and Doppler parameter are in the ranges of λ = 1150-1750 Å and b {$>$} 10 km s-1. We have tested a number of co-addition algorithms and find the noise properties of individual exposures to be closer to the Poissonian ideal than are co-added data in all cases. For unresolved absorption lines, limiting equivalent widths for co-added data are 6\% larger than limiting equivalent widths derived from individual exposures with the same signal-to-noise ratio. This ratio scales with b-value for resolved absorption lines, with co-added data having a limiting equivalent width that is 25\% larger than individual exposures when b ≈ 150 km s-1.},

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function of the galaxy distribution is a key cosmological observable that allows us to constrain the dynamical and geometrical state of our Universe. To measure the correlation function we need to know both the galaxy positions and the expected galaxy density field. The expected field is commonly specified using a Monte-Carlo sampling of the volume covered by the survey and, to minimize additional sampling errors, this random catalog has to be much larger than the data catalog. Correlation function estimators compare data-data pair counts to data-random and random-random pair counts, where random-random pairs usually dominate the computational cost. Future redshift surveys will deliver spectroscopic catalogs of tens of millions of galaxies. Given the large number of random objects required to guarantee sub-percent accuracy, it is of paramount importance to improve the efficiency of the algorithm without degrading its precision. We show both analytically and numerically that splitting the random catalog into a number of subcatalogs of the same size as the data catalog when calculating random-random pairs, and excluding pairs across different subcatalogs provides the optimal error at fixed computational cost. For a random catalog fifty times larger than the data catalog, this reduces the computation time by a factor of more than ten without affecting estimator variance or bias.},

  abstract = {A spectral-energy distribution (SED) model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is a critical tool for measuring precise and accurate distances across a large redshift range and constraining cosmological parameters. We present an improved model framework, SALT3, which has several advantages over current models including the leading SALT2 model (SALT2.4). While SALT3 has a similar philosophy, it differs from SALT2 by having improved estimation of uncertainties, better separation of color and light-curve stretch, and a publicly available training code. We present the application of our training method on a cross-calibrated compilation of 1083 SNe with 1207 spectra. Our compilation is \$2.5\textbackslash times\$ larger than the SALT2 training sample and has greatly reduced calibration uncertainties. The resulting trained SALT3.K21 model has an extended wavelength range \$2000\$-\$11000\$ angstroms (1800 angstroms redder) and reduced uncertainties compared to SALT2, enabling accurate use of low-\$z\$ \$I\$ and \$iz\$ photometric bands. Including these previously discarded bands, SALT3.K21 reduces the Hubble scatter of the low-z Foundation and CfA3 samples by 15\% and 10\%, respectively. To check for potential systematic uncertainties we compare distances of low (\$0.01},

  abstract = {Nine of the most important estimators known for the two-point correlation function are compared using a predetermined, rigorous criterion. The indicators were extracted from over 500 subsamples of the Virgo Hubble volume simulation cluster catalog. The ``real'' correlation function was determined from the full survey in a 3000 h-1 Mpc periodic cube. The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result, for astrophysical applications, a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy \& Szalay estimator, in its original or grid version (Szapudi \& Szalay), is preferred in comparison with the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton estimator.},

  abstract = {No Action Method (NoAM) is a framework for reconstructing the past orbits of observed tracers of the large-scale mass density field. It seeks exact solutions of the equations of motion (EoM), satisfying initial homogeneity and the final observed particle (tracer) positions. The solutions are found iteratively reaching a specified tolerance defined as the RMS of the distance between reconstructed and observed positions. Starting from a guess for the initial conditions, NoAM advances particles using standard N-body techniques for solving the EoM. Alternatively, the EoM can be replaced by any approximation such as Zel'dovich and second-order perturbation theory (2LPT). NoAM is suitable for billions of particles and can easily handle non-regular volumes, redshift space and other constraints. We implement NoAM to systematically compare Zel'dovich, 2LPT, and N-body dynamics over diverse configurations ranging from an idealized high-res periodic simulation box to realistic galaxy mocks. Our findings are: (I) non-linear reconstructions with Zel'dovich, 2LPT, and full dynamics perform better than linear theory only for idealized catalogues in real space. For realistic catalogues, linear theory is the optimal choice for reconstructing velocity fields smoothed on scales ≳ 5 h- 1 Mpc; (II) all non-linear back-in-time reconstructions tested here produce comparable enhancement of the baryonic oscillation signal in the correlation function.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique to create a bin-averaged Hubble diagram (HD)  from photometrically identified SN Ia data. The resulting HD is corrected for selection biases and contamination from core-collapse (CC) SNe, and can be used to infer cosmological parameters. This method, called “BEAMS with Bias Corrections” (BBC), includes two fitting stages. The first BBC fitting stage uses a posterior distribution that includes multiple SN likelihoods, a Monte Carlo simulation to bias-correct the fitted SALT-II parameters, and CC probabilities determined from a machine-learning technique. The BBC fit determines (1) a bin-averaged HD (average distance versus redshift), and (2) the nuisance parameters $\alpha$ and β, which multiply the stretch and color (respectively) to standardize the SN brightness. In the second stage, the bin-averaged HD is fit to a cosmological model where priors can be imposed. We perform high-precision tests of the BBC method by simulating large (150,000 event) data samples corresponding to the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Our tests include three models of intrinsic scatter, each with two different CC rates. In the BBC fit, the SALT-II nuisance parameters $\alpha$ and β are recovered to within 1\% of their true values. In the cosmology fit, we determine the dark energy equation of state parameter w using a fixed value of \{\{\{Ω \}\}\}\{\{M\}\} as a prior: averaging over all six tests based on 6 × 150,000 = 900,000 SNe, there is a small w-bias of 0.006+/- 0.002. Finally, the BBC fitting code is publicly available in the SNANA package.},

These simulations are used to model biases from selection effects and light-curve analysis and to determine bias corrections for SN~Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN~Ia model, incorporates information from observations (point spread function, sky noise, zero-point), and uses summary information (e.g. detection efficiency versus signal-to-noise ratio) based on 10~000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up to 0.05~mag over the redshift ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly those with extreme red or blue colour, distance biases can reach 0.4~mag. Therefore, accurately determining bias corrections is critical for precision measurements of cosmological parameters.

  abstract = {We present measurements of the Hubble diagram for 103 Type Ia supernovae  (SNe) with redshifts 0.04 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.42, discovered during the first season (Fall 2005) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. These data fill in the redshift "desert" between low- and high-redshift SN Ia surveys. Within the framework of the MLCS2K2 light-curve fitting method, we use the SDSS-II SN sample to infer the mean reddening parameter for host galaxies, RV = 2.18 ± 0.14stat ± 0.48syst, and find that the intrinsic distribution of host-galaxy extinction is well fitted by an exponential function, P(AV ) = exp(-AV /τV), with τV = 0.334 ± 0.088 mag. We combine the SDSS-II measurements with new distance estimates for published SN data from the ESSENCE survey, the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and a compilation of Nearby SN Ia measurements. A new feature in our analysis is the use of detailed Monte Carlo simulations of all surveys to account for selection biases, including those from spectroscopic targeting. Combining the SN Hubble diagram with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations from the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample and with cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy measurements from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, we estimate the cosmological parameters w and ΩM, assuming a spatially flat cosmological model (FwCDM) with constant dark energy equation of state parameter, w. We also consider constraints upon ΩM and ΩΛ for a cosmological constant model (ΛCDM) with w = -1 and non-zero spatial curvature. For the FwCDM model and the combined sample of 288 SNe Ia, we find w = -0.76 ± 0.07(stat) ± 0.11(syst), ΩM = 0.307 ± 0.019(stat) ± 0.023(syst) using MLCS2K2 and w = -0.96 ± 0.06(stat) ± 0.12(syst), ΩM = 0.265 ± 0.016(stat) ± 0.025(syst) using the SALT-II fitter. We trace the discrepancy between these results to a difference in the rest-frame UV model combined with a different luminosity correction from color variations; these differences mostly affect the distance estimates for the SNLS and HST SNe. We present detailed discussions of systematic errors for both light-curve methods and find that they both show data-model discrepancies in rest-frame U band. For the SALT-II approach, we also see strong evidence for redshift-dependence of the color-luminosity parameter (β). Restricting the analysis to the 136 SNe Ia in the Nearby+SDSS-II samples, we find much better agreement between the two analysis methods but with larger uncertainties: w = -0.92 ± 0.13(stat)+0.10 -0.33(syst) for MLCS2K2 and w = -0.92 ± 0.11(stat)+0.07 -0.15 (syst) for SALT-II.},

Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe.

From the P(k) measurements, we estimate the H I photoionization rate (Γ \_\{H I\}) in the z \&lt; 0.5 intergalactic medium. Our results confirm most of the previous Γ \_\{H I\} estimates.

Using accurate photometric redshifts and measured shapes for 4.2 million galaxies between redshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute the 2D cosmic shear correlation function over angular scales ranging between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. Using non-linear models of the dark-matter power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters by exploring the parameter space with Population Monte Carlo sampling. The best constraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scale density-fluctuations amplitude sigma\_8 scaled with the total matter density Omega\_m. For a flat LambdaCDM model we obtain sigma\_8(Omega\_m/0.27)\^0.6 = 0.79+-0.03. We combine the CFHTLenS data with WMAP7, BOSS and an HST distance-ladder prior on the Hubble constant to get joint constraints. For a flat LambdaCDM model, we find Omega\_m = 0.283+-0.010 and sigma\_8 = 0.813+-0.014. In the case of a curved wCDM universe, we obtain Omega\_m = 0.27+-0.03, sigma\_8 = 0.83+-0.04, w\_0 = -1.10+-0.15 and Omega\_K = 0.006+0.006-0.004. We calculate the Bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved LambdaCDM and dark-energy CDM models. From the combination of all four probes, we find models with curvature to be at moderately disfavoured with respect to the flat case. A simple dark-energy model is indistinguishable from LambdaCDM. Our results therefore do not necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmological model.},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

We use this analysis to separate the metal contribution from the HI absorption and present an improved measurement of the flux probability distribution function (PDF) due to HI absorption alone at = 2.07, 2.52 and 2.94. The flux PDF is sensitive to the continuum fit in the normalized flux range 0.8 {$<$} F {$<$} 1.0 and to metal absorption at 0.2 {$<$} F {$<$} 0.8. Our new measurements of the flux PDF due to HI absorption alone are systematically lower at 0.2 {$<$} F {$<$} 0.8 by up to 30 per cent compared to the widely used measurement of McDonald et al., based on a significantly smaller sample of Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer data. This discrepancy is probably due to a combination of our improved removal of the metal absorption and cosmic variance, since variations in the flux PDF between different lines-of-sight are large. The HI effective optical depth τeffHI at 1.7 {$<$} z {$<$} 4 is best fit with a single power law, , in good agreement with previous measurements from comparable data.

The increase in the number density and solid-angle coverage of SNe\textasciitilde Ia, in parallel with improvements in the standardization of their absolute magnitudes, now make them competitive probes of the growth of structure and hence of gravity. The peculiar velocity power spectrum is sensitive to the growth index \$\textbackslash gamma\$, which captures the effect of gravity on the linear growth of structure through the relation \$f=\textbackslash Omega\_M\^\textbackslash gamma\$. We present the first projections for the precision in \$\textbackslash gamma\$ for a range of realistic SN peculiar-velocity survey scenarios.

The integrated \{C IV\} column density N\_\{C IV,sys\} increases with N\_\{H I,sys\} at log N\_\{H I,sys\} in [14, \{\{16\}\}] and log N\_\{C IV,sys\} in [11.8, 14.0], then becomes almost independent of N\_\{H I,sys\} at log N\_\{H I,sys\} ≥ \{\{16\}\}, with a large scatter: at log N\_\{H I,sys\} in [14, 22], log \{N\_\{C IV,sys\}\} = [C1/log \{N\_\{H I,sys\}\} + C2\vphantom\{\} ] + C3, with C1 = -1.90 ± 0.55, C2 = -14.11 ± 0.19 and C3 = 14.76 ± 0.17, respectively. The steep (flat) part is dominated by \{Si IV\}-free (\{Si IV\}-enriched) \{C IV\} systems. Extrapolating the N\_\{H I,sys\}-N\_\{C IV,sys\} relation implies that most absorbers with log N\_\{H I\} ≤ 14 are virtually \{C IV\}-free. The N\_\{H I,sys\}-N\_\{C IV,sys\} relation does not hold for individual components, clumps or the integrated velocity range less than ±100 km s-1. This is expected if the line-of-sight extent of \{C IV\} is smaller than \{H I\} and N\_\{C IV,sys\} decreases more rapidly than N\_\{H I,sys\} at the larger impact parameter, regardless of the location of the \{H I\}+\{C IV\} gas in intergalactic medium filaments or in intervening galactic haloes.},

Finding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics have become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. Existing methods relied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova candidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of temporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch observations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a novel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images without any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the state-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric approach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating the luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another neural network for the classification, where the estimated luminance and observation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural networks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa directly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to existing photometric methods with multi-epoch observations.},

  abstract = {In this work we investigate the non-linear and non-local relation between cosmological density and peculiar velocity fields. Our goal is to provide an algorithm for the reconstruction of the non-linear velocity field from the fully non-linear density. We find that including the gravitational tidal field tensor using second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory based upon an estimate of the linear component of the non-linear density field significantly improves the estimate of the cosmic flow in comparison to linear theory not only in the low density, but also and more dramatically in the high-density regions. In particular we test two estimates of the linear component: the lognormal model and the iterative Lagrangian linearization. The present approach relies on a rigorous higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory analysis which incorporates a non-local relation. It does not require additional fitting from simulations being in this sense parameter free, it is independent of statistical-geometrical optimization and it is straightforward and efficient to compute. The method is demonstrated to yield an unbiased estimator of the velocity field on scales ≳5 h-1 Mpc with closely Gaussian distributed errors. Moreover, the statistics of the divergence of the peculiar velocity field is extremely well recovered showing a good agreement with the true one from N-body simulations. The typical errors of about 10 km s-1 (1σ confidence intervals) are reduced by more than 80 per cent with respect to linear theory in the scale range between 5 and 10 h-1 Mpc in high-density regions (δ {$>$} 2). We also find that iterative Lagrangian linearization is significantly superior in the low-density regime with respect to the lognormal model.},

ALPT is based on a combination of second order LPT (2LPT) on large scales and the spherical collapse model on smaller scales. We account for the systematic deviation of perturbative approaches from N-body simulations together with halo biasing adopting an exponential bias model. We then account for stochastic biasing by defining three regimes: a low-, an intermediate- and a high-density regime, using a Poisson distribution in the intermediate regime and the negative binomial distribution - including an additional parameter - to model over-dispersion in the high-density regime. Since we focus in this study on massive haloes, we suppress the generation of haloes in the low-density regime. The various non-linear and stochastic biasing parameters, and density thresholds, are calibrated with the large BigMultiDark N-body simulation to match the power spectrum of the corresponding halo population. Our model effectively includes only five parameters, as they are additionally constrained by the halo number density. Our mock catalogues show power spectra, in both real- and redshift-space, which are compatible with N-body simulations within about 2 per cent up to k ˜ 1 h Mpc-1 at z = 0.577 for a sample of haloes with the typical Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS (constant stellar mass galaxy sample) galaxy number density. The corresponding correlation functions are compatible down to a few Mpc. We also find that neglecting over-dispersion in high-density regions produces power spectra with deviations of 10 per cent at k ˜ 0.4 h Mpc-1. These results indicate the need to account for an accurate statistical description of the galaxy clustering for precise studies of large-scale surveys.},

  abstract = {Sound waves from the primordial fluctuations of the Universe imprinted in the large-scale structure, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), can be used as standard rulers to measure the scale of the Universe. These oscillations have already been detected in the distribution of galaxies. Here we propose to measure BAOs from the troughs (minima) of the density field. Based on two sets of accurate mock halo catalogues with and without BAOs in the seed initial conditions, we demonstrate that the BAO signal cannot be obtained from the clustering of classical disjoint voids, but it is clearly detected from overlapping voids. The latter represent an estimate of all troughs of the density field. We compute them from the empty circumsphere centers constrained by tetrahedra of galaxies using Delaunay triangulation. Our theoretical models based on an unprecedented large set of detailed simulated void catalogues are remarkably well confirmed by observational data. We use the largest recently publicly available sample of luminous red galaxies from SDSS-III BOSS DR11 to unveil for the first time a \&gt;3 σ BAO detection from voids in observations. Since voids are nearly isotropically expanding regions, their centers represent the most quiet places in the Universe, keeping in mind the cosmos origin and providing a new promising window in the analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure from galaxy surveys. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the  fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter $\alpha$ in the Einasto approximation. We show that haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the $\alpha$ parameter with a nearly constant core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.},

  abstract = {An accurate theoretical template of the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, if applicable out to nonlinear scales, enables us to extract more stringent and robust constraints on cosmological parameters from the measured galaxy clustering. In this work, we develop a simulation-based template, so-called emulator, for the redshift-space power spectrum of dark matter halos. Using the redshift-space halo power spectra measured from the Dark Quest \$N\$-body simulation suite that covers 101 flat-geometry \$w\$CDM cosmologies around the Planck \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, we feed these data into a feed-forward neural network to build the fast and accurate emulation of the power spectrum from the linear to nonlinear scales up to \$k \textbackslash simeq 0.6 \textbackslash,h \textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$. Our emulator achieves about 1\% and 5\% fractional accuracies in predicting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the power spectrum, respectively, for halos of \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{13\}h\^\{-1\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$ that correspond to host halos of the SDSS LOWZ- and CMASS-like galaxies, where the achieved accuracies are sufficient compared to the statistical errors of SDSS volume. The validation and performance of the emulator are given by the comparison of the emulator predictions with the power spectra directly measured from the simulations for validation sets that are not used in the training. We demonstrate that the emulator outputs can be used to make model predictions for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies by employing user-fed models for the halo-galaxy connection, such as the halo occupation distribution. The emulator allows us to easily incorporate the Finger-of-God effect due to the virial motions of galaxies and the Alcock-Paczy\textbackslash '\{n\}ski distortions. Our code can compute the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum in a CPU subseconds and is ready to perform the emulator-based cosmological analysis for the exiting and upcoming galaxy redshift surveys.},

For the theoretical template, we use an emulator that was built from an ensemble set of \$N\$-body simulations, which enables fast and accurate computation of the redshift-space power spectrum of halos. Combining with the halo occupation distribution to model the halo-galaxy connection, we can compute the redshift-space power spectrum of BOSS-like galaxies in the flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology. In our cosmology inference, we use the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole and include 7 nuisance parameters to model uncertainties in the halo-galaxy connection for each galaxy sample, but do not use any information on the abundance of galaxies. We demonstrate a validation of our analysis pipeline using the mock catalogs of BOSS-like galaxies, generated using different recipes of the halo-galaxy connection and including the assembly bias effect. Assuming weak priors on cosmological parameters, except for \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm b\}h\^2\$ and \$n\_\{\textbackslash rm s\}\$, we show that our model well reproduces the BOSS power spectra.

  abstract = {Peculiar velocity surveys, which measure galaxy velocities directly from standard candles in addition to redshifts, can provide strong constraints on the growth rate of structure at low redshift. The improvement originates from the physical relationship between galaxy density and peculiar velocity, which substantially reduces cosmic variance. We use Fisher matrix forecasts to show that peculiar velocity data can improve the growth rate constraints by about a factor of 2 compared to density alone for surveys with galaxy number density of 10-2 (h-1 Mpc)-3, if we can use all the information for wavenumber k ≤ 0.2 h Mpc-1. In the absence of accurate theoretical models at k = 0.2 h Mpc- 1, the improvement over redshift-only surveys is even larger - around a factor of 5 for k ≤ 0.1 h Mpc-1. Future peculiar velocity surveys, Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN), and the all-sky H I surveys, Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind Survey (WALLABY) and Westerbork Northern Sky H I Survey (WNSHS), can measure the growth rate to 3 per cent at z ∼ 0.025. Although the velocity subsample is about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift sample from the same survey, it improves the constraint by 40 per cent compared to the same survey without velocity measurements. Peculiar velocity surveys can also measure the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per cent uncertainties in bins with widths Δk = 0.01 h Mpc-1 in the range k ≤ 0.1 h Mpc-1, which is a large improvement over galaxy density only. Such measurements on very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity or non-Gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or galaxy bias. We test our modelling in detail using N-body simulations.},

This mismatch in ΓHI results in the mean flux decrement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest being overpredicted by at least a factor of two (a 10σ discrepancy with observations) and a column density distribution of Ly$\alpha$ forest absorbers systematically and significantly elevated compared to observations over nearly two decades in column density. We examine potential resolutions to this mismatch and find that either conventional sources of ionizing photons (galaxies and quasars) must contribute considerably more than current observational estimates or our theoretical understanding of the low-redshift universe is in need of substantial revision.},

  abstract = {This work presents the application of a new tool, Obiwan, which uses image simulations to determine the selection function of a galaxy redshift survey and calculate three-dimensional (3D) clustering statistics. Obiwan relies on a forward model of the process by which images of the night sky are transformed into a 3D large-scale structure catalogue, and offers several advantages over more traditional map-based techniques - such as operating on individual exposures and adopting a maximum likelihood approach. The photometric pipeline automatically detects and models galaxies and then generates a catalogue of such galaxies with detailed information for each one of them, including their location, redshift, and so on. Systematic biases in the imaging data are therefore imparted into the catalogues and must be accounted for in any scientific analysis of their information content. Obiwan simulates this process for samples selected from the Legacy Surveys imaging data. This imaging data will be used to select target samples for the next-generation Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) experiment. Here, we apply Obiwan to a portion of the SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey emission-line galaxies (ELGs). Systematic biases in the data are clearly identified and removed. We compare the 3D clustering results to those obtained by the map-based approach applied to the complete eBOSS Data Release 16 (DR16) sample. We find the results are consistent, thereby validating the eBOSS DR16 ELG catalogues, which is used to obtain cosmological results.},

  abstract = {We present a new compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), a new data set of low-redshift nearby-Hubble-flow SNe, and new analysis procedures to work with these heterogeneous compilations. This ``Union'' compilation of 414 SNe Ia, which reduces to 307 SNe after selection cuts, includes the recent large samples of SNe Ia from the Supernova Legacy Survey and ESSENCE Survey, the older data sets, as well as the recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A single, consistent, and blind analysis procedure is used for all the various SN Ia subsamples, and a new procedure is implemented that consistently weights the heterogeneous data sets and rejects outliers. We present the latest results from this Union compilation and discuss the cosmological constraints from this new compilation and its combination with other cosmological measurements (CMB and BAO). The constraint we obtain from supernovae on the dark energy density is ΩΛ=0.713+0.027-0.029(stat)+0.036-0.039(sys), for a flat, ΛCDM universe. Assuming a constant equation of state parameter, w, the combined constraints from SNe, BAO, and CMB give w=-0.969+0.059-0.063(stat)+0.063-0.066(sys). While our results are consistent with a cosmological constant, we obtain only relatively weak constraints on a w that varies with redshift. In particular, the current SN data do not yet significantly constrain w at z{$>$}1. With the addition of our new nearby Hubble-flow SNe Ia, these resulting cosmological constraints are currently the tightest available.},

We used a 3D tomographic map of the absorption with an effective comoving spatial resolution of 2.5 h -1 Mpc and a volume of 3.15 × 105 h -3 Mpc3, which was reconstructed from moderate-resolution Keck I/LRIS spectra of 240 background Lyman-break galaxies and quasars in a 0.16 deg2 footprint in the COSMOS field. Voids were detected using a spherical overdensity finder calibrated from hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). This allows us to identify voids in the IGM corresponding to voids in the underlying matter density field, yielding a consistent volume fraction of voids in both data (19.5\%) and simulations (18.2\%). We fit excursion set models to the void radius function and compare the radially averaged stacked profiles of large voids (r {$>$} 5 h -1 Mpc) to stacked voids in mock observations and the simulated density field. Comparing with 432 coeval galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the same volume as the tomographic map, we find that the tomography-identified voids are underdense in galaxies by 5.95σ compared to random cells.},

The remaining chapters discuss star formation over a variety of scales, starting with the galactic scale and working down to the scales of individual stars and their disks. The book concludes with a brief discussion of the clearing of disks and the transition to planet formation. The book includes five problem sets, complete with solutions.},

  abstract = {The thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z {$<$} 6 constrains the nature and timing of cosmic reionization events, but its inference from the Ly$\alpha$ forest is degenerate with the 3D structure of the IGM on ˜100 kpc scales, where, analogous to the classical Jeans argument, the pressure of the T ≃ 104 K gas supports it against gravity. We simulate the IGM using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and find that, at z {$<$} 6, the gas density power spectrum does not exhibit the expected filtering scale cutoff, because dense gas in collapsed halos dominates the small-scale power masking pressure smoothing effects. We introduce a new statistic, the real-space Ly$\alpha$ flux, Freal, which naturally suppresses dense gas, and is thus robust against the poorly understood physics of galaxy formation, revealing pressure smoothing in the diffuse IGM. The Freal power spectrum is accurately described by a simple fitting function with cutoff at λF, allowing us to rigorously quantify the pressure smoothing scale for the first time: we find λF = 79 kpc (comoving) at z = 3 for our fiducial thermal model. This statistic has the added advantage that it directly relates to observations of correlated Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption in close quasar pairs, recently proposed as a method to measure the pressure smoothing scale. Our results enable one to quantify the pressure smoothing scale in simulations, and ask meaningful questions about its dependence on reionization and thermal history. Accordingly, the standard description of the IGM in terms of the amplitude T0 and slope γ of the temperature-density relation T=\{T\}0\{(ρ /\textbackslash bar\{ρ \})\}γ -1 should be augmented with a third pressure smoothing scale parameter λF.},

  abstract = {Observed data are often contaminated by undiscovered interlopers, leading to biased parameter estimation. Here we present BEAMS (Bayesian estimation applied to multiple species) which significantly improves on the standard maximum likelihood approach in the case where the probability for each data point being “pure” is known. We discuss the application of BEAMS to future type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) surveys, such as LSST, which are projected to deliver over a million supernovae light curves without spectra. The multiband light curves for each candidate will provide a probability of being Ia (pure) but the full sample will be significantly contaminated with other types of supernovae and transients. Given a sample of N supernovae with mean probability, ⟨P⟩, of being Ia, BEAMS delivers parameter constraints equal to N⟨P⟩ spectroscopically confirmed SNIa. In addition BEAMS can be simultaneously used to tease apart different families of data and to recover properties of the underlying distributions of those families (e.g. the type-Ibc and II distributions). Hence BEAMS provides a unified classification and parameter estimation methodology which may be useful in a diverse range of problems such as photometric redshift estimation or, indeed, any parameter estimation problem where contamination is an issue.},

The assumption that the mean pairwise velocity of the gas component follows that of the dark matter is studied here at small separations, and we find that even at pair separations of 10-20 h\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc, there is a 4-5\% velocity bias. At smaller separations, it gets larger with varying strength depending on the sub-grid prescription. By isolating different physical processes, our findings suggest that the large-scale velocity bias is mainly driven by stellar rather than active galactic nuclei feedback. If unaccounted for, this velocity offset could possibly bias cosmological constraints from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Furthermore, we examined how the first and the second moment of the pairwise velocity are affected by both the baryonic and the neutrino free-streaming effects for both the matter and gas components. For both moments, we were able to disentangle the effects of baryonic processes from those of massive neutrinos; and for pair separations below 20 h\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc, we find that these moments of the pairwise velocity decrease with increasing neutrino mass. Our work thus sets out a way in which the pairwise velocity statistics can be utilised to constrain the summed mass of neutrinos from future CMB surveys and peculiar velocity surveys.},

  abstract = {Starting from first principles, we derive the fundamental equations that relate the \$n\$-point correlation functions in real and redshift space. Our result generalises the so-called `streaming model' to higher-order statistics: the full \$n\$-point correlation in redshift-space is obtained as an integral of its real-space counterpart times the joint probability density of \$n-1\$ relative line-of-sight peculiar velocities. Equations for the connected \$n\$-point correlation functions are obtained by recursively applying the generalised streaming model for decreasing \$n\$. Our results are exact within the distant-observer approximation and completely independent of the nature of the tracers for which the correlations are evaluated. Focusing on 3-point statistics, we use an \$N\$-body simulation to study the joint probability density function of the relative line-of-sight velocities of pairs of particles in a triplet. On large scales, we find that this distribution is approximately Gaussian and that its moments can be accurately computed with standard perturbation theory. We use this information to formulate a phenomenological 3-point Gaussian streaming model. A practical implementation is obtained by using perturbation theory at leading order to approximate several statistics in real space. In spite of this simplification, the resulting predictions for the matter 3-point correlation function in redshift space are in rather good agreement with measurements performed in the simulation. We discuss the limitations of the simplified model and suggest a number of possible improvements. Our results find direct applications in the analysis of galaxy clustering but also set the basis for studying 3-point statistics with future peculiar-velocity surveys and experiments based on the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.},

  abstract = {The streaming model describes the mapping between real and redshift space for 2-point clustering statistics. Its key element is the probability density function (PDF) of line-of-sight pairwise peculiar velocities. Following a kinetic-theory approach, we derive the fundamental equations of the streaming model for ordered and unordered pairs. In the first case, we recover the classic equation while we demonstrate that modifications are necessary for unordered pairs. We then discuss several statistical properties of the pairwise velocities for DM particles and haloes by using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations. We test the often used Gaussian ansatz for the PDF of pairwise velocities and discuss its limitations. Finally, we introduce a mixture of Gaussians which is known in statistics as the generalized hyperbolic distribution and show that it provides an accurate fit to the PDF. Once inserted in the streaming equation, the fit yields an excellent description of redshift-space correlations at all scales that vastly outperforms the Gaussian and exponential approximations. Using a principal-component analysis, we reduce the complexity of our model for large redshift-space separations. Our results increase the robustness of studies of anisotropic galaxy clustering and are useful for extending them towards smaller scales in order to test theories of gravity and interacting dark-energy models.},

In this approach, galaxies of a given type are probabilistically assigned to individual halos in N-body simulations. In this paper, we present a fast emulator for predicting the fully nonlinear galaxy-galaxy auto and galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum and correlation function over a range of freely specifiable HOD modeling parameters. The emulator is constructed using results from 100 HOD models run on a large ΛCDM N-body simulation, with Gaussian Process interpolation applied to a PCA-based representation of the galaxy power spectrum. The total error is currently ∼1\% in the auto correlations and ∼2\% in the cross correlations from z = 1 to z = 0, over the considered parameter range. We use the emulator to investigate the accuracy of various analytic prescriptions for the galaxy power spectrum, parametric dependencies in the HOD model, and the behavior of galaxy bias as a function of HOD parameters. Additionally, we obtain fully nonlinear predictions for tangential shear correlations induced by galaxy-galaxy lensing from our galaxy-dark matter cross power spectrum emulator.

We quantify both effects for currently available galaxy samples using simulated mock catalogues of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) following a lognormal model, with a Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (\$\textbackslash Lambda\textbackslash text\{CDM\}\$) correlation function and similar properties as the samples (number density, mean redshift for the \$\textbackslash Lambda\textbackslash text\{CDM\}\$ correlation function, survey geometry, mass-luminosity bias). Because we need extensive simulations to quantify small statistical effects, we cannot use realistic N-body simulations and some physical effects are neglected. Our simulations still enable a comparison of the different estimators by looking at their biases and variances. We also test the reliability of the BAO detection in the SDSS samples and study the compatibility of the data results with our \$\textbackslash Lambda\textbackslash text\{CDM\}\$ simulations.},

We find coincident values of these two measures in the range ̃300-400 km s\textsuperscript{-1}, not far from the expected mean peculiar velocities of groups and galaxy clusters. When analysing the distribution of the pairwise relative velocities of voids, we find a remarkable bimodal behaviour consistent with an excess of both systematically approaching and receding voids. We determine that the origin of this bimodality resides in the void large-scale environment, since once voids are classified into void-in-void (R-type) or void-in-cloud (S-type), R-types are found mutually receding away, while S-types approach each other. The magnitude of these systematic relative velocities account for more than 100 km s\textsuperscript{-1}, reaching large coherence lengths of up to 200 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc . We have used samples of voids from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and the peculiar velocity field inferred from linear theory, finding fully consistent results with the simulation predictions. Thus, their relative motion suggests a scenario of a sparkling universe, with approaching and receding voids according to their local environment.},

After carefully removing the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of each source, we show that by stacking thousands of spectra, it is possible to measure statistical flux fluctuations at the 10\textsuperscript{-3} level, detect more than 20 DIBs and measure their strength as a function of position on the sky. We create a map of DIB absorption covering about 5000 deg\textsuperscript{2} and measure correlations with various tracers of the interstellar medium: atomic and molecular hydrogen, dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). After recovering known correlations, we show that each DIB has a different dependence on atomic and molecular hydrogen: while they are all positively correlated with N\_\{H I\}, they exhibit a range of behaviours with N\_\{H\_2\} showing positive, negative or no correlation. We show that a simple parametrization involving only N\_\{H I\} and N\_\{H\_2\} applied to all the DIBs is sufficient to reproduce a large collection of observational results reported in the literature: it allows us to naturally describe the relations between DIB strength and dust reddening (including the so-called skin effect), the related scatter, DIB pair-wise correlations and families, the affinity for σ/ζ-type environments and other correlations related to molecules. Our approach allows us to characterize DIB dependencies in a simple manner and provides us with a metric to characterize the similarity between different DIBs.},

Our full-scale analysis yields constraints on the growth of structure that are a factor of two more stringent than any other study on large scales at similar redshifts. We infer \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.471 \textbackslash pm 0.024\$ at \$z \textbackslash approx 0.25\$, and \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.431 \textbackslash pm 0.025\$ at \$z \textbackslash approx 0.40\$; the corresponding \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM predictions of the Planck CMB analysis are \$0.470 \textbackslash pm 0.006\$ and \$0.476 \textbackslash pm 0.005\$, respectively. Our results are thus consistent with Planck, but also follow the trend seen in previous low-redshift measurements of \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8\$ falling slightly below the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM+CMB prediction. We find that small and large radial scales yield mutually consistent values of \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8\$, but there are \$1-2.5 \textbackslash sigma\$ hints of small scales (\${$<$} 10 \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$) preferring lower values for \$f \textbackslash sigma\_8\$ relative to larger scales. We analyse the constraining power of the full range of radial scales, finding that most of the multipole information about \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ is contained in the scales \$2 \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\} \textbackslash lesssim s \textbackslash lesssim 20 \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$. Evidently, once the cosmological information of the quasi-to-nonlinear regime has been harvested, large-scale modes contain only modest additional information about structure growth. Finally, we compare predictions for the galaxy-galaxy lensing amplitude of the two samples against measurements from SDSS and assess the lensing-is-low effect in light of our findings.},

We use a "forced photometry" technique, using measured SDSS source positions, star-galaxy separation and galaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the WISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code, working on our "unWISE" coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands, so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero. However, for many sources we get three- or four-sigma measurements; these sources would not be reported by the WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at catalog level. The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent set of sources between SDSS and WISE, taking advantage of the resolution and depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements in our photometry. Our results, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me.},

We show that changes in the data reduction strategy throughout different data releases have led to a better accuracy at long wavelengths, in particular for sky line subtraction, but a degradation at short wavelengths with the emergence of systematic spectral features with an amplitude of about 1 per cent. We show that these features originate from inaccuracy in the fitting of modelled F-star spectra used for flux calibration. The best-fitting models for those stars are found to systematically overestimate the strength of metal lines and underestimate that of Lithium. We also identify the existence of artefacts due to masking and interpolation procedures at the wavelengths of the hydrogen Balmer series leading to the existence of artificial Balmer $\alpha$ absorption in all SDSS optical spectra. All these effects occur in the rest frame of the standard stars and therefore present Galactic longitude variations due to the rotation of the Galaxy. We demonstrate that the detection of certain weak absorption lines reported in the literature is solely due to calibration effects. Finally, we discuss new strategies to mitigate these issues.},

However, the He II flux probability density function (PDF) can be used to determine the timing of helium II reionization. The amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum can also determine the ionization state of helium II. We show that, even given the currently limited number of observations (∼50 sightlines), measurements of the flux PDF can yield information about helium II reionization. Further, measurements using the one-dimensional power spectrum can provide clear indications of the timing of reionization, as well as the relative bias of sources of ionizing radiation. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of \textasciitilde 0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {$<$} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution \textasciitilde 250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

Alternatively, using a flat ΛCDM fiducial cosmology with CMB-derived parameters, and measuring the quasar bias relative to this ΛCDM model, our data provide a consistency check of the model, in terms of how homogeneous the Universe is on different scales.

I first describe the algorithm in details alongside its performances. This algorithm is implemented in the VIRBIUS (VelocIty Reconstruction using Bayesian Inference Software) software package. I then test it on different mock distance catalogues with a varying complexity of observational issues. The model proved to give robust measurement of velocities for mock catalogues of 3000 galaxies. I expect the core of the algorithm to scale to tens of thousands galaxies. It holds the promises of giving a better handle on future large and deep distance surveys for which individual errors on distance would impede velocity field inference.},

We describe the algorithm that we use to detect and stack voids in redshift shells on the light cone and test it on mock light cones produced from N-body simulations. We establish a robust statistical model for estimating the average stretching of voids in redshift space and quantify the contamination by peculiar velocities. Finally, assuming that the void statistics that we derive from N-body simulations is preserved when considering galaxy surveys, we assess the capability of this approach to constrain dark energy parameters. We report this assessment in terms of the figure of merit (FoM) of the dark energy task force and in particular of the proposed Euclid mission which is particularly suited for this technique since it is a spectroscopic survey. The FoM due to stacked voids from the Euclid wide survey may double that of all other dark energy probes derived from Euclid data alone (combined with Planck priors). In particular, voids seem to outperform baryon acoustic oscillations by an order of magnitude. This result is consistent with simple estimates based on mode counting. The AP test based on stacked voids may be a significant addition to the portfolio of major dark energy probes and its potentialities must be studied in detail.},

  abstract = {Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) is an optical fiber-bundle integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopic survey that is one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV). With a spectral coverage of 3622-10354 Å and an average footprint of ̃500 arcsec\textsuperscript{2} per IFU the scientific data products derived from MaNGA will permit exploration of the internal structure of a statistically large sample of 10,000 low-redshift galaxies in unprecedented detail. Comprising 174 individually pluggable science and calibration IFUs with a near-constant data stream, MaNGA is expected to obtain ̃100 million raw-frame spectra and ̃10 million reduced galaxy spectra over the six-year lifetime of the survey. In this contribution, we describe the MaNGA Data Reduction Pipeline algorithms and centralized metadata framework that produce sky-subtracted spectrophotometrically calibrated spectra and rectified three-dimensional data cubes that combine individual dithered observations. For the 1390 galaxy data cubes released in Summer 2016 as part of SDSS-IV Data Release 13, we demonstrate that the MaNGA data have nearly Poisson-limited sky subtraction shortward of ̃8500 Å and reach a typical 10σ limiting continuum surface brightness μ = 23.5 AB arcsec\textsuperscript{-2} in a five-arcsecond-diameter aperture in the g-band. The wavelength calibration of the MaNGA data is accurate to 5 km s\textsuperscript{-1} rms, with a median spatial resolution of 2.54 arcsec FWHM (1.8 kpc at the median redshift of 0.037) and a median spectral resolution of σ = 72 km s\textsuperscript{-1}.},

  abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a fully-automated, wide-field survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves for detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60 inch telescope. PTF uses 80\% of the 1.2 m and 50\% of the 1.5 m telescope time. With an exposure of 60 s the survey reaches a depth of m≈21.3 and m≈20.6 (5σ, median seeing). Four major experiments are planned for the five-year project: (1) a 5 day cadence supernova search; (2) a rapid transient search with cadences between 90 s and 1 day; (3) a search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion; and (4) a 3π sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF provides automatic, real-time transient classification and follow-up, as well as a database including every source detected in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including several months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey camera, the observing plans, and the data reduction strategy. We conclude by detailing the first 51 PTF optical transient detections, found in commissioning data.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a function of host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes that regulate star formation. We derive the total stellar mass fraction f sstarf (excluding stars in the intracluster light) as a function of halo mass M 500c from z = 0.2 to z = 1 using two complementary methods. First, we derive f sstarf using a statistical Halo Occupation Distribution model jointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar mass function. This method enables us to probe f sstarf over a much wider halo mass range than with group or cluster catalogs. Second, we derive f sstarf at group scales using a COSMOS X-ray group catalog and show that the two methods agree to within 30\%. We quantify the systematic uncertainty on f sstarf using abundance matching methods and show that the statistical uncertainty on f sstarf (\textasciitilde 10\%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar mass measurements (\textasciitilde 45\% excluding initial mass function, IMF, uncertainties). Assuming a Chabrier IMF, we find 0.012 {$<$}= f sstarf {$<$}= 0.025 at M 500c = 1013 M ⊙ and 0.0057 {$<$}= f sstarf {$<$}= 0.015 at M 500c = 1014 M ⊙. These values are significantly lower than previously published estimates. We investigate the cause of this difference and find that previous work has overestimated f sstarf owing to a combination of inaccurate stellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in groups are early-type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Contrary to previous claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f sstarf is always significantly lower than f gas for halos above 1013 M ⊙. Combining our results with recently published gas mass fractions, we find a shortfall in f sstarf + f gas at R 500c compared to the cosmic mean. This shortfall varies with halo mass and becomes larger toward lower halo masses.},

We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogues trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two-dimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40 per cent larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of S\_8=σ \_8 \textbackslash sqrt\{Ω \_m/0.3\} compared to Planck Collaboration XIII reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (r {$<$} 10 h-1 Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos and modifications to general relativity on ΔΣ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effect of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

  abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework that combines measurements of  galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, and the galaxy stellar mass function in a self-consistent manner. While considerable effort has been invested in exploring each of these probes individually, attempts to combine them are still in their infancy. These combinations have the potential to elucidate the galaxy-dark matter connection and the galaxy formation physics responsible for it, as well as to constrain cosmological parameters and to test the nature of gravity. In this paper, we focus on a theoretical model that describes the galaxy-dark matter connection based on standard halo occupation distribution techniques. Several key modifications enable us to extract additional parameters that determine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and to simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent binning schemes for each probe. We construct mock catalogs from numerical simulations to investigate the effects of sample variance and covariance for each probe. Finally, we analyze how trends in each of the three observables impact the derived parameters of the model. In particular, we investigate various features of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (low-mass slope, "plateau," knee, and high-mass cutoff) and show how each feature is related to the underlying relationship between stellar and halo mass. We demonstrate that the observed "plateau" feature in the stellar mass function at M * \textasciitilde{} 2 × 1010 M sun is due to the transition that occurs in the stellar-to-halo mass relation at Mh \textasciitilde{} 1012 M sun from a low-mass power-law regime to a sub-exponential function at higher stellar mass.},

  abstract = {What do we know about voids in the dark matter distribution given the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and assuming the ΛCDM model? Recent application of the Bayesian inference algorithm BORG to the SDSS Data Release 7 main galaxy sample has generated detailed Eulerian and Lagrangian representations of the large-scale structure as well as the possibility to accurately quantify corresponding uncertainties. Building upon these results, we present constrained catalogs of voids in the Sloan volume, aiming at a physical representation of dark matter underdensities and at the alleviation of the problems due to sparsity and biasing on galaxy void catalogs. To do so, we generate data-constrained reconstructions of the presently observed large-scale structure using a fully non-linear gravitational model. We then find and analyze void candidates using the VIDE toolkit. Our methodology therefore predicts the properties of voids based on fusing prior information from simulations and data constraints. For usual void statistics (number function, ellipticity distribution and radial density profile), all the results obtained are in agreement with dark matter simulations. Our dark matter void candidates probe a deeper void hierarchy than voids directly based on the observed galaxies alone. The use of our catalogs therefore opens the way to high-precision void cosmology at the level of the dark matter field.

We measure the transmission PDF from 3393 Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 9, and compare with mock spectra that include careful modeling of the noise, continuum, and astrophysical uncertainties. The BOSS transmission PDFs, measured at langzrang = [2.3, 2.6, 3.0], are compared with PDFs created from mock spectra drawn from a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that sample the IGM temperature-density relationship, γ, and temperature at mean density, T \textsubscript{0}, where T(∆) = T \textsubscript{0}∆\textsuperscript{γ - 1}. We find that a significant population of partial Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) with a column-density distribution slope of β\textsubscript{pLLS} \textasciitilde{} - 2 are required to explain the data at the low-transmission end of transmission PDF, while uncertainties in the mean Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission affect the high-transmission end. After modeling the LLSs and marginalizing over mean transmission uncertainties, we find that γ = 1.6 best describes the data over our entire redshift range, although constraints on T \textsubscript{0} are affected by systematic uncertainties. Within our model framework, isothermal or inverted temperature-density relationships (γ \&lt;= 1) are disfavored at a significance of over 4σ, although this could be somewhat weakened by cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties that we did not model.},

  abstract = {We present the first observations of foreground Ly$\alpha$ forest  absorption from high-redshift galaxies, targeting 24 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with z \textasciitilde{} 2.3-2.8 within a 5' × 14' region of the COSMOS field. The transverse sightline separation is \textasciitilde 2 h -1 Mpc comoving, allowing us to create a tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption field over the redshift range 2.20 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 2.45. The resulting map covers 6 h -1 Mpc × 14 h -1 Mpc in the transverse plane and 230 h -1 Mpc along the line of sight with a spatial resolution of ≈3.5 h -1 Mpc, and is the first high-fidelity map of a large-scale structure on \textasciitilde Mpc scales at z {$>$} 2. Our map reveals significant structures with {$>\sptilde$} 10 h -1 Mpc extent, including several spanning the entire transverse breadth, providing qualitative evidence for the filamentary structures predicted to exist in the high-redshift cosmic web. Simulated reconstructions with the same sightline sampling, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio recover the salient structures present in the underlying 3D absorption fields. Using data from other surveys, we identified 18 galaxies with known redshifts coeval with our map volume, enabling a direct comparison with our tomographic map. This shows that galaxies preferentially occupy high-density regions, in qualitative agreement with the same comparison applied to simulations. Our results establish the feasibility of the CLAMATO survey, which aims to obtain Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra for \textasciitilde 1000 SFGs over \textasciitilde 1 deg2 of the COSMOS field, in order to map out the intergalactic medium large-scale structure at langzrang \textasciitilde{} 2.3 over a large volume (100 h -1 Mpc)3.},

  abstract = {Continuum fitting is an important aspect of Ly$\alpha$ forest science,  since errors in the derived optical depths scale with the fractional continuum error. However, traditional methods of estimating continua in noisy and moderate-resolution spectra (e.g., Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS; S/N {$<\sptilde$} 10 pixel-1 and R \textasciitilde{} 2000), such as power-law extrapolation or dividing by the mean spectrum, achieve no better than \textasciitilde 15\% rms accuracy. To improve on this, we introduce mean-flux-regulated principal component analysis (MF-PCA) continuum fitting. In this technique, PCA fitting is carried out redward of the quasar Ly$\alpha$ line in order to provide a prediction for the shape of the Ly$\alpha$ forest continuum. The slope and amplitude of this continuum prediction is then corrected using external constraints for the Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux. This requires prior knowledge of the mean flux, langFrang, but significantly improves the accuracy of the flux transmission, F ≡ exp (- τ), estimated from each pixel. From tests on mock spectra, we find that MF-PCA reduces the errors to 8\% rms in S/N \textasciitilde{} 2 spectra, and {$<$}5\% rms in spectra with S/N {$>\sptilde$} 5. The residual Fourier power in the continuum is decreased by a factor of a few in comparison with dividing by the mean continuum, enabling Ly$\alpha$ flux power spectrum measurements to be extended to \textasciitilde 2 × larger scales. Using this new technique, we make available continuum fits for 12,069 z {$>$} 2.3 Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra from SDSS Data Release 7 for use by the community. This technique is also applicable to future releases of the ongoing Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey, which obtains spectra for \textasciitilde 150, 000 Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra at low signal-to-noise (S/N \textasciitilde{} 2).},

  abstract = {Context. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used to measure the  expansion of the Universe. Improving distance measurements of SNe Ia is one technique to better constrain the acceleration of expansion and determine its physical nature. Aims: This document develops a new SNe Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model, called the SUpernova Generator And Reconstructor (SUGAR), which improves the spectral description of SNe Ia, and consequently could improve the distance measurements. Methods: This model was constructed from SNe Ia spectral properties and spectrophotometric data from the Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. In a first step, a principal component analysis-like method was used on spectral features measured at maximum light, which allowed us to extract the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia. Next, the intrinsic properties were used to extract the average extinction curve. Third, an interpolation using Gaussian processes facilitated using data taken at different epochs during the lifetime of an SN Ia and then projecting the data on a fixed time grid. Finally, the three steps were combined to build the SED model as a function of time and wavelength. This is the SUGAR model. Results: The main advancement in SUGAR is the addition of two additional parameters to characterize SNe Ia variability. The first is tied to the properties of SNe Ia ejecta velocity and the second correlates with their calcium lines. The addition of these parameters, as well as the high quality of the Nearby Supernova Factory data, makes SUGAR an accurate and efficient model for describing the spectra of normal SNe Ia as they brighten and fade. Conclusions: The performance of this model makes it an excellent SED model for experiments like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, or the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. The data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/636/A46},

The imprint of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) on the matter power spectrum can be constrained using the neutral hydrogen density in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as a tracer of the matter density. One of the goals of the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) is to derive the Hubble expansion rate and the angular scale from the BAO signal in the IGM. To this aim, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest about 150 000 quasars will be observed in the redshift range 2.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 3.5 and over \textasciitilde 10 000 deg\textsuperscript{2}. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We simulated the BOSS QSO survey to estimate the statistical accuracy on the BAO scale determination provided by such a large-scale survey. In particular, we discuss the effect of the poorly constrained estimate of the quasar's unabsorbed intrinsic spectrum. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The volume of current N-body simulations being too small for such studies, we resorted to Gaussian random field (GRF) simulations. We validated the use of GRFs by comparing the output of GRF simulations with that of the Horizon-4Π N-body dark-matter-only simulation with the same initial conditions. Realistic mock samples of QSO Lyman-$\alpha$ forest were generated and their power spectrum computed and fitted to obtain the BAO scale. The rms of the results for 100 different simulations provides an estimate of the statistical error expected from the BOSS survey. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We confirm the results from the Fisher matrix estimate. In the absence of error on the quasar's unabsorbed spectrum, our simulations give an expected uncertainty of 2.3\% for the BOSS quasar survey measurement of the BAO scale. The expected uncertainties for the transverse and radial BAO scales are 6.8\% and 3.9\%, respectively. The significance of the BAO detection is assessed by an average ∆χ\textsuperscript{2} = 17 but ∆χ\textsuperscript{2} ranges from 2 to 35 for individual realizations. The error on the quasar's unabsorbed spectrum increases the error on the BAO scale by 10 to 20\% and results in a subpercent bias. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

This discrepancy has prompted speculation that new physics might be required beyond that assumed in the ΛCDM model. In this paper, we apply the inverse distance ladder to fit a parametric form of H(z) to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Type Ia supernova (SNe) data together with priors on the sound horizon at the end of the radiation drag epoch, r\textsubscript{d}. We apply priors on r\textsubscript{d}, based on inferences from either Planck or the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and demonstrate that these values are consistent with CMB-independent determination of r\textsubscript{d} derived from measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance, BAO and supernova data assuming the ΛCDM cosmology. The H(z) constraints that we derive are independent of detailed physics within the dark sector at low redshifts, relying only on the validity of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric of General Relativity. For each assumed prior on r\textsubscript{d}, we find consistency with the inferred value of H\textsubscript{0} and the Planck ΛCDM value and corresponding tension with the distance ladder estimate.},

We compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys, showing that DESI will be able to detect the Doppler contribution in a Large Scale Structure (LSS) survey for the first time, with a S/N {$>$}7 for rmin {$>$} 10 Mpc/h, where rmin denotes the minimum comoving separation between sources. We demonstrate that several physical parameters, introduced to provide a full modelling of the cross-correlation function, are affected by the Doppler contribution.

  abstract = {Modelling of the weak lensing of the CMB will be crucial to obtain correct cosmological parameter constraints from forthcoming precision CMB anisotropy observations. The lensing affects the power spectrum as well as inducing non-Gaussianities. We discuss the simulation of full sky CMB maps in the weak lensing approximation and describe a fast numerical code. The series expansion in the deflection angle cannot be used to simulate accurate CMB maps, so a pixel remapping must be used. For parameter estimation accounting for the change in the power spectrum but assuming Gaussianity is sufficient to obtain accurate results up to Planck sensitivity using current tools. A fuller analysis may be required to obtain accurate error estimates and for more sensitive observations. We demonstrate a simple full sky simulation and subsequent parameter estimation at Planck-like sensitivity. The lensed CMB simulation and parameter estimation codes are publicly available.},

To this end, we study the dependence of the BAO signal on the population of voids classified by their sizes. We find for the first time the characteristic features of the correlation function of voids including the first robust detection of BAOs in mock galaxy catalogues. These show an anti-correlation around the scale corresponding to the smallest size of voids in the sample (the void exclusion effect), and dips at both sides of the BAO peak, which can be used to determine the significance of the BAO signal without any priori model. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that there is a scale-dependent bias for different populations of voids depending on the radius, with the peculiar property that the void population with the largest BAO significance corresponds to tracers with approximately zero bias on the largest scales. We further investigate the methodology on an additional set of 1000 realistic mock galaxy catalogues reproducing the SDSS-III/BOSS CMASS DR11 data, to control the impact of sky mask and radial selection function. Our solution is based on generating voids from randoms including the same survey geometry and completeness, and a post-processing cleaning procedure in the holes and at the boundaries of the survey. The methodology and optimal selection of void populations validated in this work have been used to perform the first BAO detection from voids in observations, presented in a companion paper.},

It uses the isotropy of the galaxy density gradient field to constrain cosmological parameters. If the density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$ or the dark energy equation of state \$w\$ are incorrectly chosen, the gradient field appears to be anisotropic with the degree of anisotropy varying with redshift. We use this effect to constrain the cosmological parameters governing the expansion history of the Universe. Although redshift-space distortions (RSD) induced by galaxy peculiar velocities also produce anisotropies in the gradient field, these effects are close to uniform in magnitude over a large range of redshift. This makes the redshift variation of the gradient field anisotropy relatively insensitive to the RSD. By testing the method on mock surveys drawn from the Horizon Run 3 cosmological N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the cosmological parameters can be estimated without bias. Our method is complementary to the baryon acoustic oscillation or topology methods as it depends on \$D\_AH\$, the product of the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter.},

  abstract = {Optimal analyses using the 2-point functions of large-scale structure probes require accurate covariance matrices. A covariance matrix of the 2-point function comprises the disconnected part and the connected part. While the connected covariance only becomes important on small scales, the disconnected covariance is dominant on large scales, where the survey window has a significant impact. In this work, we develop an analytical method to compute the disconnected covariance, accounting for the window effect. Derived under the flat-sky approximation, our formalism is applicable to wide surveys by swapping in the curved-sky window functions. Our method works for both the power spectrum and the correlation function, and applies to the covariances of various probes including the multipoles and the wedges of 3D clustering, the angular and the projected statistics of clustering and shear, as well as the cross covariances between different probes. We verify the analytic covariance against the sample covariance from the galaxy mock simulations in two test cases: (1) the power spectrum multipole covariance, and (2) the joint covariance of the projected correlation function and the correlation function multipoles. Our method achieve good agreement with the mocks, while at a negligible computational cost. Unlike mocks, our analytic covariance is free of sampling noise, which often leads to numerical problems and the need to inflate the errors. In addition, our method can use the best-fit power spectrum as input, in contrast to the standard procedure of using a fiducial model that may deviate significantly from the truth. We also show that a naive diagonal power spectrum covariance underestimates the signal-to-noise ratio compared to our analytic covariance.

  abstract = {The amplitude of fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest on small spatial scales is sensitive to the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and its spatial fluctuations. The temperature of the IGM and its spatial variations contain important information about hydrogen and helium reionization. We present a new measurement of the small-scale structure in the Ly$\alpha$ forest from 40 high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio, VLT spectra for absorbing gas at redshifts between 2.2 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 4.2. We convolve each Ly$\alpha$ forest spectrum with a suitably chosen Morlet wavelet filter, which allows us to extract the amount of small-scale structure in the forest as a function of position across each spectrum. We monitor contamination from metal line absorbers. We present a first comparison of these measurements with high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest that track more than 2 billion particles. This comparison suggests that the IGM temperature close to the cosmic mean density (T 0) peaks at a redshift near z = 3.4, at which point it is greater than 20, 000 K at gsim2σ confidence. The temperature at lower redshift is consistent with the fall-off expected from adiabatic cooling (T 0 vprop (1 + z)2), after the peak temperature is reached near z = 3.4. In our highest redshift bin, centered around z = 4.2, the results favor a temperature of T 0 = 15-20, 000 K. However, owing mostly to uncertainties in the mean transmitted flux at this redshift, a cooler IGM model with T 0 = 10, 000 K is only disfavored at the 2σ level here, although such cool IGM models are strongly discrepant with the z ≈ 3-3.4 measurement. We do not detect large spatial fluctuations in the IGM temperature at any redshift covered by our data set. The simplest interpretation of our measurements is that He II reionization completes sometime near z ≈ 3.4, although statistical uncertainties are still large. Our method can be fruitfully combined with future He II Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements.},

The CRs are generated by combining a Wiener filter estimator in spherical Fourier-Bessel space with random realizations of log-normally distributed density fields and Poisson-sampled galaxy positions. The algorithm is tested and calibrated on a set of semi-analytic mock catalogues mimicking the environment of the Local Group (LG), to rigorously account for the statistical and systematic errors of the reconstruction method. By comparing our peculiar velocity CRs with the observed velocities from the Cosmicflows-3 catalogue, we constrain the normalized linear growth rate to \$f \textbackslash sigma \_8\^\{\textbackslash text\{lin\}\}= 0.367 \textbackslash pm 0.060\$, which is consistent at the 1.1σ level with the latest Planck results as well as other direct probes.

We find that accurate prediction of the matter power spectrum in f(R) gravity places stronger requirements on the simulation than is the case with Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) because of the non-linear nature of the fifth force. Linear perturbation theory is shown to be a poor approximation for the f(R) models, except when the chameleon effect is very weak. We show that the relative differences from the fiducial ΛCDM model are much more pronounced in the non-linear tail of the velocity divergence power spectrum than in the matter power spectrum, which suggests that future surveys which target the collection of peculiar velocity data will open new opportunities to constrain modified gravity theories. A close investigation of the time evolution of the power spectra shows that there is a pattern in the evolution history, which can be explained by the properties of the chameleon-type fifth force in f(R) gravity. Varying the model parameter |fR0|, which quantifies the strength of the departure from standard gravity, mainly varies the epoch marking the onset of the fifth force, as a result of which the different f(R) models are in different stages of the same evolutionary path at any given time.},

  abstract = {This paper is the first in a set that analyses the covariance matrices of clustering statistics obtained from several approximate methods for gravitational structure formation. We focus here on the covariance matrices of anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories: predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field deterministically (ICE-COLA, PEAK PATCH, and PINOCCHIO), methods that require a calibration with N-body simulations (PATCHY and HALOGEN), and simpler recipes based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations (lognormal and Gaussian density fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover the mean parameter values inferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results within 5 per cent for our lower mass threshold and 10 per cent for our higher mass threshold. Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to 20 per cent depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with no single method clearly outperforming the others.},

We calibrate LyMAS using Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of a (100 h\textsuperscript{- 1} Mpc)\textsuperscript{3} comoving volume. We apply this calibration to a (1 h\textsuperscript{- 1} Gpc)\textsuperscript{3} simulation realized with 2048\textsuperscript{3} dark matter particles. In the 100 h\textsuperscript{- 1} Mpc box, LyMAS reproduces the halo-flux correlations computed from the full hydrodynamic gas distribution very well. In the 1 h\textsuperscript{- 1} Gpc box, the amplitude of the large-scale cross-correlation tracks the halo bias b\textsubscript{h} as expected. We provide empirical fitting functions that describe our numerical results. In the transverse separation bins used for the BOSS analyses, LyMAS cross-correlation predictions follow linear theory accurately down to small scales. Fitting the BOSS measurements requires inclusion of random velocity errors; we find best-fitting rms velocity errors of 399 and 252 \{km\} \{s\}\^\{-1\} for quasars and DLAs, respectively.

  abstract = {Cosmology is one of the four science pillars of LSST, which promises to be transformative for our understanding of dark energy and dark matter. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) has been tasked with deriving constraints on cosmological parameters from LSST data. Each of the cosmological probes for LSST is heavily impacted by the choice of observing strategy. This white paper is written by the LSST DESC Observing Strategy Task Force (OSTF), which represents the entire collaboration, and aims to make recommendations on observing strategy that will benefit all cosmological analyses with LSST. It is accompanied by the DESC DDF (Deep Drilling Fields) white paper (Scolnic et al.). We use a variety of metrics to understand the effects of the observing strategy on measurements of weak lensing, large-scale structure, clusters, photometric redshifts, supernovae, strong lensing and kilonovae. In order to reduce systematic uncertainties, we conclude that the current baseline observing strategy needs to be significantly modified to result in the best possible cosmological constraints. We provide some key recommendations: moving the WFD (Wide-Fast-Deep) footprint to avoid regions of high extinction, taking visit pairs in different filters, changing the 2x15s snaps to a single exposure to improve efficiency, focusing on strategies that reduce long gaps ({$>$}15 days) between observations, and prioritizing spatial uniformity at several intervals during the 10-year survey.},

  abstract = {Automated photometric supernova classification has become an active area of research in recent years in light of current and upcoming imaging surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, given that spectroscopic confirmation of type for all supernovae discovered will be impossible. Here, we develop a multi-faceted classification pipeline, combining existing and new approaches. Our pipeline consists of two stages: extracting descriptive features from the light curves and classification using a machine learning algorithm. Our feature extraction methods vary from model-dependent techniques, namely SALT2 fits, to more independent techniques that fit parametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet approach. We cover a range of representative machine learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and boosted decision trees (BDTs). We test the pipeline on simulated multi-band DES light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge. Using the commonly used area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic as a metric, we find that the SALT2 fits and the wavelet approach, with the BDTs algorithm, each achieve an AUC of 0.98, where 1 represents perfect classification. We find that a representative training set is essential for good classification, whatever the feature set or algorithm, with implications for spectroscopic follow-up. Importantly, we find that by using either the SALT2 or the wavelet feature sets with a BDT algorithm, accurate classification is possible purely from light curve data, without the need for any redshift information.},

  abstract = {In Lyman-alpha forest measurements it is generally assumed that quasars are mere background light sources which are uncorrelated with the forest. Gravitational lensing of the quasars violates this assumption. This effect leads to a measurement bias, but more interestingly it provides a valuable signal. The lensing signal can be extracted by correlating quasar magnitudes with the flux power spectrum and with the flux decrement. These correlations will be challenging to measure but their detection provides a direct measure of how features in the Lyman-alpha forest trace the underlying mass density field. Observing them will test the fundamental hypothesis that fluctuations in the forest are predominantly driven by fluctuations in mass, rather than in the ionizing background, helium reionization or winds. We discuss ways to disentangle the lensing signal from other sources of such correlations, including dust, continuum and background residuals. The lensing-induced measurement bias arises from sample selection: one preferentially collects spectra of magnified quasars which are behind overdense regions. This measurement bias is \textasciitilde 0.1-1\% for the flux power spectrum, optical depth and the flux probability distribution. Since the effect is systematic, quantities such as the amplitude of the flux power spectrum averaged across scales should be interpreted with care.},

  abstract = {We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this inter-connectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep (WFD) area of approximately 300 deg\^2 as well as a deep drilling field (DDF) of approximately 1 deg\^2. We simulate 5-years of the planned 10-year survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, it serves as a realistic testbed environment for the LSST Science Pipelines. Second, the LSST DESC analysis working groups can use the dataset to develop a range of pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Third, simulated data provides a controlled way to investigate systematic effects, in particular those associated with how the LSST Science Pipelines interact with the observed data. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time-domain cosmology.},

  abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg\^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg\^2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\textasciitilde 27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\textasciitilde 1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

We produce a suite of simulations, covering the observationally relevant redshift range 2 ≤ z ≤ 4. We find that a grid resolution of 20 h-1 kpc is required to produce 1 per cent convergence of Ly$\alpha$ forest flux statistics, up to k = 10 h-1 Mpc. In addition to establishing resolution requirements, we study the effects of missing modes in these simulations, and find that box sizes of L {$>$} 40h-1 Mpc are needed to suppress numerical errors to a sub-per cent level. Our optically thin simulations with the ionizing background prescription of Haardt \& Madau reproduce an intergalactic medium density-temperature relation with T0 ≈ 104 K and γ ≈ 1.55 at z = 2, with a mean transmitted flux close to the observed values. When using the ionizing background prescription of Faucher-Giguère et al., the mean flux is 10-15 per cent below observed values at z = 2, and a factor of 2 too small at z = 4. We show the effects of the common practice of rescaling optical depths to the observed mean flux and how it affects convergence rates. We also investigate the practice of `splicing' results from a number of different simulations to estimate the 1D flux power spectrum and show it is accurate at the 10 per cent level. Finally, we find that collisional heating of the gas from dark matter particles is negligible in modern cosmological simulations.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} The second \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data release (\emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} DR2) provides precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) for an unprecedented number of sources (more than 1.3 billion, mostly stars). This new wealth of data will enable the undertaking of statistical analysis of many astrophysical problems that were previously infeasible for lack of reliable astrometry, and in particular because of the lack of parallaxes. However, the use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how can the astrophysical parameters of interest be properly inferred from these data?\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} The main focus of this paper, but not the only focus, is the issue of the estimation of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined with other information. We start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on how to use parallaxes more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian methods. In particular we also show that negative parallaxes, or parallaxes with relatively large uncertainties still contain valuable information. Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric data for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and parallaxes and the handling of covariances in the uncertainties.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The paper contains examples based on simulated \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} data to illustrate the problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} archive documentation that provide practical examples and a good starting point for the application of the recommendations to actual problems. In all cases the source code for the analysis methods is provided.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our main recommendation is to always treat the derivation of (astro-)physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} will provide fundamental data for many fields of astronomy. Further data releases will provide more data, and more precise data. Nevertheless, to fully use the potential it will always be necessary to pay careful attention to the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions. The purpose of this paper is to help astronomers find the correct approach.}}}}}}}}}}},

This catalog comprises the largest selection of spectroscopically confirmed quasars to date. The full catalog includes two subcatalogs (the current versions are DR16Q\_v4 and DR16Q\_Superset\_v3 at https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr16/eboss/qso/DR16Q/): a "superset" of all SDSS-IV/eBOSS objects targeted as quasars containing 1,440,615 observations and a quasar-only catalog containing 750,414 quasars, including 225,082 new quasars appearing in an SDSS data release for the first time, as well as known quasars from SDSS-I/II/III. We present automated identification and redshift information for these quasars alongside data from visual inspections for 320,161 spectra. The quasar-only catalog is estimated to be 99.8\% complete with 0.3\%-1.3\% contamination. Automated and visual inspection redshifts are supplemented by redshifts derived via principal component analysis and emission lines. We include emission-line redshifts for H$\alpha$, Hβ, Mg II, C III], C IV, and Ly$\alpha$. Identification and key characteristics generated by automated algorithms are presented for 99,856 broad absorption-line quasars and 35,686 damped Lyman alpha quasars. In addition to SDSS photometric data, we also present multiwavelength data for quasars from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, UKIDSS, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, FIRST, ROSAT/2RXS, XMM-Newton, and Gaia. Calibrated digital optical spectra for these quasars can be obtained from the SDSS Science Archive Server.},

Whereas traditional measurements of H\textsubscript{0} with SNe Ia use a distance ladder of parallax and Cepheid variable stars, the inverse distance ladder relies on absolute distance measurements from the BAOs to calibrate the intrinsic magnitude of the SNe Ia. We find H\textsubscript{0} = 67.8 ± 1.3 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} (statistical and systematic uncertainties, 68 per cent confidence). Our measurement makes minimal assumptions about the underlying cosmological model, and our analysis was blinded to reduce confirmation bias. We examine possible systematic uncertainties and all are below the statistical uncertainties. Our H\textsubscript{0} value is consistent with estimates derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background assuming a ΛCDM universe.},

  abstract = {The peculiar velocities of galaxies are an inherently valuable cosmological probe, providing an unbiased estimate of the distribution of matter on scales much larger than the depth of the survey. Much research interest has been motivated by the high dipole moment of our local peculiar velocity field, which suggests a large-scale excess in the matter power spectrum and can appear to be in some tension with the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model. We use a composite catalogue of 4537 peculiar velocity measurements with a characteristic depth of 33 h−1 Mpc to estimate the matter power spectrum. We compare the constraints with this method, directly studying the full peculiar velocity catalogue, to results by Macaulay et al., studying minimum variance moments of the velocity field, as calculated by Feldman, Watkins \&amp; Hudson. We find good agreement with the ΛCDM model on scales of k \&gt; 0.01 h Mpc−1. We find an excess of power on scales of k \&lt; 0.01 h Mpc−1 with a 1σ uncertainty which includes the ΛCDM model. We find that the uncertainty in excess at these scales is larger than an alternative result studying only moments of the velocity field, which is due to the minimum variance weights used to calculate the moments. At small scales, we are able to clearly discriminate between linear and non-linear clustering in simulated peculiar velocity catalogues and find some evidence (although less clear) for linear clustering in the real peculiar velocity data.},

It has recently been shown that measurements of the peculiar velocity field indicate an anomalously high bulk flow of galaxies in our local volume. In this paper, we find the implications of the high bulk flow for the power spectrum of density fluctuations. We find that analysing only the dipole moment of the velocity field yields an average power spectrum amplitude which is indeed much higher than the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) value. However, by also including shear and octupole moments of the velocity field, and marginalizing over possible values for the growth rate, an average power spectrum amplitude which is consistent with the ΛCDM is recovered. We attempt to infer the shape of the matter power spectrum from moments of the velocity field, and find a slight excess of power on scales ∼1 h−1 Gpc.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM + HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works. Isentropic initial conditions on superhorizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein, and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM + HDM models with neutrino mass densities Ων = 0.2 and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM + HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics.},

The hydrogen component in a highly inhomogeneous universe is completely reionized when the number of photons emitted above 1 ryd in one recombination time equals the mean number of hydrogen atoms. If stellar sources are responsible for keeping the IGM ionized at z=5, the rate of star formation at this epoch must be comparable or greater than the one inferred from optical observations of galaxies at z\textasciitilde 3 and the mean metallicity per baryon in the universe {$>\sptilde$}0.002 solar. An early generation of stars in dark matter halos with circular velocities, vcirc\textasciitilde 50 km s-1, possibly one of the main sources of UV photons at high z, could be detectable with the Next Generation Space Telescope. Models in which the quasar emissivity declines rapidly at z{$>\sptilde$}3 predict a late He II reionization epoch, a feature that could explain the recent detection of patchy He II Ly$\alpha$ at z=2.9 by Reimers et al. and the abrupt change observed by Songaila at about the same epoch of the Si IV /C IV ratio, but appear unable to provide the required number of hydrogen-ionizing photons at z\textasciitilde 5.},

We argue that Groth \& Peebles may have removed some intrinsic clustering when they corrected for large-scale gradients in the Lick counts. our analysis has important implications for theories of the formation of large-scale structure.

As a result standard time series methods regularly used for financial and similar datasets are of little help and astronomers are usually left to their own instruments and techniques to classify light curves. A common approach is to derive statistical features from the time series and to use machine learning methods, generally supervised, to separate objects into a few of the standard classes. In this work, we transform the time series to two-dimensional light curve representations in order to classify them using modern deep learning techniques. In particular, we show that convolutional neural networks based classifiers work well for broad characterization and classification. We use labeled datasets of periodic variables from CRTS survey and show how this opens doors for a quick classification of diverse classes with several possible exciting extensions.},

  abstract = {The observed 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization will be distorted along the line-of-sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. These redshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will also make it anisotropic. This anisotropy contains information about the cross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogen field, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about the sources of reionization. In this paper, we study a collection of simulated reionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources of reionization. We show that the 21-cm anisotropy is best measured by the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum. We find that, unless the properties of the reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolves very predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. This predictability implies that redshift-space distortions are not a very sensitive tool for distinguishing between reionization sources. However, the quadrupole moment can be used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history. We show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generation instruments such as LOFAR, while the SKA should be able to measure the reionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to great accuracy.},

Using the optical (u*, g', r', i') and NIR data (z', Ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, for identifying stars, AGNs and galaxies improving the purity of the VIPERS sample. Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning algorithms allow the automatic classification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we tailored the SVM for classifying stars, AGNs and galaxies, and applied this classification to the VIPERS data. We train the SVM using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the VIPERS and VVDS surveys. We tested two SVM classifiers and concluded that including NIR data can significantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. The self-check of the best optical + NIR classifier has shown a 97\% accuracy in the classification of galaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for AGNs in the 5-dimensional colour space. In the test on VIPERS sources with 99\% redshift confidence, the classifier gives an accuracy equal to 94\% for galaxies, 93\% for stars, and 82\% for AGNs. The method was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify their classification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4 900 objects. We conclude that the SVM algorithm trained on a carefully selected sample of galaxies, AGNs, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selection methods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification method particularly suitable for modern large surveys.},

We compare the sample covariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discuss differences. We have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to Data Release 9 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), producing 600 mock catalogues of the `CMASS' galaxy sample.

  abstract = {We use cosmological N-body simulations to investigate whether measurements of the moments of large-scale structure can yield constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. We measure the variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the evolved density field from simulations with Gaussian and three different non-Gaussian initial conditions: a local model with f\_NL=100, an equilateral model with f\_NL=-400, and an orthogonal model with f\_NL=-400. We show that the moments of the dark matter density field differ significantly between Gaussian and non-Gaussian models. We also make the measurements on mock galaxy catalogs that contain galaxies with clustering properties similar to those of luminous red galaxies (LRGs). We find that, in the case of skewness and kurtosis, galaxy bias reduces the detectability of non-Gaussianity, though we can still clearly discriminate between different models in our simulation volume. However, in the case of the variance, galaxy bias greatly amplifies the detectability of non-Gaussianity. In all cases we find that redshift distortions do not significantly affect the detectability. When we restrict our measurements to volumes equivalent to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) or Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) samples, the probability of detecting a departure from the Gaussian model is high by using measurements of the variance, but very low by using only skewness and kurtosis measurements. We find that skewness and kurtosis measurements are never likely to yield useful constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity, but future surveys should be large enough to place meaningful constraints using measurements of the galaxy variance.(Abridged)},

  abstract = {The peculiar velocity of the intergalactic gas responsible for the cosmic 21-cm background from the epoch of reionization and beyond introduces an anisotropy in the three-dimensional power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations. Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21-cm surveys is a promising tool for separating cosmology from 21-cm astrophysics. However, previous attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or only approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar velocity on the 21-cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and addressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that even the angle-averaged power spectrum, P(k), is affected significantly by the peculiar velocity. (2) We re-derive the brightness temperature dependence on atomic hydrogen density, spin temperature, peculiar velocity and its gradient and redshift to clarify the roles of thermal versus velocity broadening and finite optical depth. (3) We show that properly accounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of the 21-cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the intergalactic medium found by previous work that employed the usual optically thin approximation. (4) We find that the approximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness temperature problem by capping the velocity gradient can misestimate the power spectrum on all scales. (5) We further show that the observed power spectrum in redshift space remains finite even in the optically thin approximation if one properly accounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full account of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate in the limit of high spin temperature. (6) We also show that the linear theory for redshift-space distortion widely employed to predict the 21-cm power spectrum results in a ̃30 per cent error in the observationally relevant wavenumber range k̃ 0.1-1 h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, when strong ionization fluctuations exist (e.g. at the 50 per cent ionized epoch). We derive an alternative, quasi-linear formulation which improves upon the accuracy of the linear theory. (7) We describe and test two numerical schemes to calculate the 21-cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporate peculiar velocity effects in the optically thin approximation accurately, by real- to redshift-space re-mapping of the H I density. One is particle based, the other grid based, and while the former is most accurate, we demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and can be optimized so as to achieve sufficient accuracy.},

  abstract = {A large bulk flow, which is in tension with the Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, has been observed. In this paper, we provide a physically plausible explanation of this bulk flow, based on the assumption that some fraction of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background is due to an intrinsic fluctuation, so that the subtraction of the observed dipole leads to a mismatch between the cosmic microwave background defined rest frame and the matter rest frame. We investigate a model that takes into account the relative velocity (hereafter the tilted velocity) between the two frames, and develop a Bayesian statistic to explore the likelihood of this tilted velocity. By studying various independent peculiar velocity catalogs, we find that (1) the magnitude of the tilted velocity u is around 400km/s, and its direction is close to what is found from previous bulk flow analyses; for most catalogs analyzed, u=0 is excluded at about the 2.5σ level; (2) constraints on the magnitude of the tilted velocity can result in constraints on the duration of inflation, due to the fact that inflation can neither be too long (no dipole effect) nor too short (very large dipole effect); (3) under the assumption of a superhorizon isocurvature fluctuation, the constraints on the tilted velocity require that inflation lasts at least 6 e-folds longer (at the 95\% confidence interval) than that required to solve the horizon problem. This opens a new window for testing inflation and models of the early universe from observations of large scale structure.},

  abstract = {We calculate stellar masses for ˜400 000 massive luminous galaxies  at redshift ˜0.2-0.7 using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy distributions to u, g, r, i, z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies are used to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. Accurate BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow (Δlog M ˜ 0.5 dex) and peaks at about log M/M⊙ ˜ 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2-0.6, in agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by BOSS extend over ˜1012 M⊙, providing unprecedented measurements of the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number density above ˜2.5 × 1011 M⊙ agrees with previous determinations. We perform a comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance of massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but the models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with redshift is detected from ˜0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the lack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due to metallicity, which is too low in the models.},

Calibration errors are primarily due to atmospheric differential refraction and guiding offsets during each exposure. The corrections potentially reduce the systematics for any studies of BOSS quasars, including the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations using the Ly$\alpha$ forest. Our model suggests that, on average, the observed quasar flux in BOSS is overestimated by ∼19\% at 3600 Å and underestimated by ∼24\% at 10,000 Å. Our corrections for the entire BOSS quasar sample are publicly available.},

  abstract = {We consider the application of relative self-calibration using overlap regions to spectroscopic galaxy surveys that use slit-less spectroscopy. This method is based on that developed for the SDSS by Padmanabhan at al. (2008) in that we consider jointly fitting and marginalising over calibrator brightness, rather than treating these as free parameters. However, we separate the calibration of the detector-to-detector from the full-focal-plane exposure-to-exposure calibration. To demonstrate how the calibration procedure will work, we simulate the procedure for a potential implementation of the spectroscopic component of the wide Euclid survey. We study the change of coverage and the determination of relative multiplicative errors in flux measurements for different dithering configurations. We use the new method to study the case where the flat-field across each exposure or detector is measured precisely and only exposure-to-exposure or detector-to-detector variation in the flux error remains. We consider several base dither patterns and find that they strongly influence the ability to calibrate, using this methodology. To enable self-calibration, it is important that the survey strategy connects different observations with at least a minimum amount of overlap, and we propose an "S"-pattern for dithering that fulfills this requirement. The final survey strategy adopted by Euclid will have to optimise for a number of different science goals and requirements. The large-scale calibration of the spectroscopic galaxy survey is clearly cosmologically crucial, but is not the only one.},

  abstract = {Using almost one million galaxies from the final Data Release 12 of the SDSS's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), we have obtained, albeit with low significance, a first model-independent determination of the radial baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak with 9 per cent error: ∆z\textsubscript{BAO}(z\textsubscript{eff} = 0.51) = 0.0456 ± 0.0042. In order to obtain this measurement, the radial correlation function was computed in 7700 angular pixels, from which the mean correlation function and covariance matrix were obtained, making the analysis completely model-independent. This novel method of obtaining the covariance matrix was validated via comparison with 500 BOSS mock catalogues. This ∆z\textsubscript{BAO} determination can be used to constrain the background expansion of exotic models for which the assumptions adopted in the standard analysis cannot be satisfied. Future galaxy catalogues from J-PAS, DESI, and Euclid are expected to significantly increase the quality and significance of model-independent determinations of the BAO peak, possibly determined at various redshift and angular positions. We stress that it is imperative to test the standard paradigm in a model-independent way in order to test its foundations, maximize the extraction of information from the data, and look for clues regarding the poorly understood dark energy and dark matter.},

  abstract = {Upcoming surveys will map the growth of large-scale structure with unprecented precision, improving our understanding of the dark sector of the Universe. Unfortunately, much of the cosmological information is encoded by the small scales, where the clustering of dark matter and the effects of astrophysical feedback processes are not fully understood. This can bias the estimates of cosmological parameters, which we study here for a joint analysis of mock Euclid cosmic shear and Planck cosmic microwave background data. We use different implementations for the modelling of the signal on small scales and find that they result in significantly different predictions. Moreover, the different nonlinear corrections lead to biased parameter estimates, especially when the analysis is extended into the highly nonlinear regime, with both the Hubble constant, \$H\_0\$, and the clustering amplitude, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, affected the most. Improvements in the modelling of nonlinear scales will therefore be needed if we are to resolve the current tension with more and better data. For a given prescription for the nonlinear power spectrum, using different corrections for baryon physics does not significantly impact the precision of Euclid, but neglecting these correction does lead to large biases in the cosmological parameters. In order to extract precise and unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters from Euclid cosmic shear data, it is therefore essential to improve the accuracy of the recipes that account for nonlinear structure formation, as well as the modelling of the impact of astrophysical processes that redistribute the baryons.},

We measure the equivalent widths of 50 individual metal absorption lines in 5 intervals of DLA hydrogen column density, 5 intervals of DLA redshift, and overall mean equivalent widths for an additional 13 absorption features from groups of strongly blended lines. The mean equivalent width of low-ionization lines increases with \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm HI\}\$, whereas for high-ionization lines the increase is much weaker. The mean metal line equivalent widths decrease by a factor \$\textbackslash sim 1.1-1.5\$ from \$z\textbackslash sim2.1\$ to \$z \textbackslash sim 3.5\$, with small or no differences between low- and high-ionization species. We develop a theoretical model, inspired by the presence of multiple absorption components observed in high-resolution spectra, to infer mean metal column densities from the equivalent widths of partially saturated metal lines. We apply this model to 14 low-ionization species and to AlIII, SIII, SiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI. We use an approximate derivation for separating the equivalent width contributions of several lines to blended absorption features, and infer mean equivalent widths and column densities from lines of the additional species NI, ZnII, CII\$\{\}\^\{*\}\$, FeIII, and SIV. Several of these mean column densities of metal lines in DLAs are obtained for the first time; their values generally agree with measurements of individual DLAs from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra when they are available.},

  abstract = {The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new robotic time-domain survey currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern visible sky at rates of ∼3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g ∼ 20.8 and r ∼ 20.6 mag (AB, 5σ in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines, alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and analyzing the products. The real-time pipeline employs a novel image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point-source transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures are also extracted and vetted. We present some preliminary results of the calibration performance delivered by the real-time pipeline. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per science image with respect to Gaia DR1 is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is the RMS per-axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N ≥ 10 and hence corresponds to the typical astrometric uncertainty down to this limit. The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes varies between 8 and 25 millimag. The high end of these ranges corresponds to an airmass approaching ∼2—the limit of the public survey. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2\%. The products support a broad range of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae; rare flux transients; variable stars; eclipsing binaries; variability from active galactic nuclei; counterparts to gravitational wave sources; a more complete census of Type Ia supernovae; and solar-system objects.},

The relation between Eulerian and Lagrangian kernels of density perturbations with biasing is derived. The effects of primordial non-Gaussianity and redshift-space distortions are also incorporated in our general formalism, and diagrammatic methods are introduced. Vertex resummations of higher-order perturbations in the presence of bias are considered. Resummations of Lagrangian bias are shown to be essential to handle biasing schemes in a general framework.},

  abstract = {We develop a new approach to study the nonlinear evolution in the  large-scale structure of the Universe both in real space and in redshift space, extending the standard perturbation theory of gravitational instability. Infinite series of terms in standard Eulerian perturbation theory are resummed as a result of our starting from a Lagrangian description of perturbations. Delicate nonlinear effects on scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations are more accurately described by our method than the standard one. Our approach differs from other resummation techniques recently proposed, such as the renormalized perturbation theory, etc., in that we use simple techniques and thus resulting equations are undemanding to evaluate, and in that our approach is capable of quantifying the nonlinear effects in redshift space. The power spectrum and correlation function of our approach are in good agreement with numerical simulations in literature on scales of baryon acoustic oscillations. Especially, nonlinear effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the correlation function are accurately described both in real space and in redshift space. Our approach provides a unique opportunity to analytically investigate the nonlinear effects on baryon acoustic scales in observable redshift space, which is requisite in constraining the nature of dark energy, the curvature of the Universe, etc., by redshift surveys.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopic galaxy surveys contain a wealth of cosmological information. Acoustic waves that propagated in the primordial Universe left a signature on the matter distribution, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), at a characteristic scale of 150 megaparsecs. Measuring this standard ruler in the distribution of galaxies provides access to the expansion history of the Universe. In addition, redshift measurements of galaxies are sensitive to their peculiar velocities (RSD), allowing to probe the growth rate of structure and test general relativity on large scales. This thesis is dedicated to the power spectrum analysis of BAO and RSD in the sample of 173,736 emission line galaxies (ELGs) of the eBOSS collaboration, at an effective redshift of 0.85. Special care was devoted to validate the implementation of the galaxy power spectrum theoretical model, and to estimate and correct observational systematics, with the help of realistic simulations. The main observational systematics of this sample stem from fluctuations of the galaxy target density with the quality of the photometric sample used for eBOSS, which is an early version of that utilised in the next generation spectroscopic survey DESI. In particular, besides the noticeable fluctuations of the angular density of targets, strong variations in the redshift density with imaging depth were noted - an effect which is usually assumed to be minor. Residual variations of the angular target density were mitigated by suppressing the density contrast above a certain scale, while fluctuations in the radial survey selection function were accounted for by dividing the data set in subsamples of equivalent photometric depth. Doing so, the measured galaxy power spectrum is damped at large scale, which requires to correct the theoretical prediction for the so-called integral constraints, an original work of this thesis that also allowed to improve some techniques of clustering analyses. The RSD and BAO measurements obtained with eBOSS ELGs are combined with the results from the other clustering samples of the SDSS collaboration, and cosmological implications are presented. This manuscript ends with a recap of different observational and analysis systematics hindering the cosmological measurements, and gives ideas to control the systematic budget of future spectroscopic surveys, like DESI.},

  abstract = {The global climate crisis poses new risks to humanity, and with them, new challenges to the practices of professional astronomy. Avoiding the more catastrophic consequences of global warming by more than 1.5 degrees requires an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the 2018 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel report, this will necessitate a 45\% reduction of emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Efforts are required at all levels, from the individual to the governmental, and every discipline must find ways to achieve these goals. This will be especially difficult for astronomy with its significant reliance on conference and research travel, among other impacts. However, our long-range planning exercises provide the means to coordinate our response on a variety of levels. We have the opportunity to lead by example, rising to the challenge rather than reacting to external constraints. We explore how astronomy can meet the challenge of a changing climate in clear and responsible ways, such as how we set expectations (for ourselves, our institutions, and our granting agencies) around scientific travel, the organization of conferences, and the design of our infrastructure. We also emphasize our role as reliable communicators of scientific information on a problem that is both human and planetary in scale.},

  abstract = {On very large scales, density fluctuations in the Universe are small,  suggesting a perturbative model for large-scale clustering of galaxies (or other dark matter tracers), in which the galaxy density is written as a Taylor series in the local mass density, δ, with the unknown coefficients in the series treated as free ``bias'' parameters. We extend this model to include dependence of the galaxy density on the local values of ∇i∇jphi and ∇ivj, where phi is the potential and v is the peculiar velocity. We show that only two new free parameters are needed to model the power spectrum and bispectrum up to 4th order in the initial density perturbations, once symmetry considerations and equivalences between possible terms are accounted for. One of the new parameters is a bias multiplying sijsji, where sij = [∇i∇j∇-2-(1/3)δKij]δ. The other multiplies sijtji, where tij = [∇i∇j∇-2-(1/3)δKij](θ-δ), with θ = -(a H dln D/dln a)-1∇bold dotv. (There are other, observationally equivalent, ways to write the two terms, e.g., using θ-δ instead of sijsji.) We show how short-range (non-gravitational) non-locality can be included through a controlled series of higher derivative terms, starting with R2∇2δ, where R is the scale of non-locality (this term will be a small correction as long as k2R2 is small, where k is the observed wavenumber). We suggest that there will be much more information in future huge redshift surveys in the range of scales where beyond-linear perturbation theory is both necessary and sufficient than in the fully linear regime.},

  abstract = {We explore the requirements for a Lyman-$\alpha$ forest survey designed to measure the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at 2≲z≲4 using the standard ruler provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal would be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the three-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A percent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit, relative to the case with only a similar precision measurement at z̃1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This improvement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z̃1 survey, with Planck and a weak Sloan Digital Sky Survey-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z̃1 may be able to make an effective Ly$\alpha$ forest measurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number density of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a function of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and signal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg. and achieving S/N=1.8 per Å at g=23 (̃40quasars per sq. deg.) with an R≳250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse oscillation scales to 1.4\% from the Ly$\alpha$ forest (or better, if fainter magnitudes and possibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in the sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify a quasar and find a redshift. Because the Ly$\alpha$ forest is much closer to linear and generally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less likely to be a problem. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We analyze the SDSS Ly$\alpha$ forest PF(k, z) measurement to  determine the linear theory power spectrum. Our analysis is based on fully hydrodynamic simulations, extended using hydro-particle-mesh simulations. We account for the effect of absorbers with damping wings, which leads to an increase in the slope of the linear power spectrum. We break the degeneracy between the mean level of absorption and the linear power spectrum without significant use of external constraints. We infer linear theory power spectrum amplitude Δ2L(kp=0.009 s km-1, zp=3.0)=0.452+0.069-0.057+0.141-0.116 and slope neff(kp, zp)=-2.321+0.055-0.047+0.131-0.102 (possible systematic errors are included through nuisance parameters in the fit: a factor {$>\sptilde$}5 smaller errors would be obtained on both parameters if we ignored modeling uncertainties). The errors are correlated and not perfectly Gaussian, so we provide a χ2 table to accurately describe the results. The result corresponds to σ8=0.85, n=0.94 for a ΛCDM model with Ωm=0.3, Ωb=0.04, and h=0.7 but is most useful in a combined fit with the CMB. The inferred curvature of the linear power spectrum and the evolution of its amplitude and slope with redshift are consistent with expectations for ΛCDM models, with the evolution of the slope, in particular, being tightly constrained. We use this information to constrain systematic contamination, e.g., fluctuations in the UV background. This paper should serve as a starting point for more work to refine the analysis, including technical improvements such as increasing the size and number of the hydrodynamic simulations and improvements in the treatment of the various forms of feedback from galaxies and quasars.},

This sample is almost 2 orders of magnitude larger than any previously available data set, yielding statistical errors of \textasciitilde 0.6\% and \textasciitilde 0.005 on, respectively, the overall amplitude and logarithmic slope of PF(k, z). This unprecedented statistical power requires a correspondingly careful analysis of the data and of possible systematic contaminations in it. For this purpose we reanalyze the raw spectra to make use of information not preserved by the standard pipeline. We investigate the details of the noise in the data, resolution of the spectrograph, sky subtraction, quasar continuum, and metal absorption. We find that background sources such as metals contribute significantly to the total power and have to be subtracted properly. We also find clear evidence for Si III correlations with the Ly$\alpha$ forest and suggest a simple model to account for this contribution to the power. Our tests indicate that any residual systematics in the analysis are unlikely to affect the inference of cosmological parameters from PF(k, z). These results should provide an essential ingredient for all future attempts to constrain modeling of structure formation, cosmological parameters, and theories for the origin of primordial fluctuations.},

Using hydro-PM simulations, I compute the three-dimensional power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest flux, PF(k), from which the redshift-space anisotropy of the correlation can be obtained. I compute directly the linear theory bias parameters of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, potentially allowing simulation results to be extended to arbitrarily large scales. I investigate the dependence of PF(k) on the primordial power spectrum, the temperature-density relation of the gas, and the mean flux decrement, finding that the redshift-space anisotropy is relatively insensitive to these parameters. A table of results is provided for different parameter variations. I investigate the constraint that can be obtained on ΩΛ using quasars from a large survey. Assuming 13(θ/1')2 pairs at a separation of less than θ and including separations less than 10', a measurement to {$<\sptilde$}5\% can be made if simulations can predict the redshift-space anisotropy with {$<\sptilde$}5\% accuracy or to {$<\sptilde$}10\% if the anisotropy must be measured from the data. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will obtain spectra for a factor of \textasciitilde 5 fewer pairs than this, so follow-up observations of fainter pair candidates will be necessary. I discuss the requirements on the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SDSS quality spectra are sufficient). I find that a box size of \textasciitilde 40 h-1 Mpc and a resolution of \textasciitilde 40 h-1 kpc are necessary for convergence of the calculations to {$<\sptilde$}5\% on all relevant scales, although somewhat poorer resolution can be used for large scales.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the temperature in the intergalactic medium is related to the reionization of hydrogen and helium and has important consequences for our understanding of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and of galaxy formation. We measure the temperature-density relation of intergalactic gas from Ly$\alpha$ forest observations of eight quasar spectra, using a new line fitting technique to obtain a lower cutoff on the distribution of line widths from which the temperature is derived. Using a numerical simulation, we examine the details of this kind of measurement at different densities, finding that the temperature may be difficult to measure for gas with Δg{$<\sptilde$}1 (Δg is the density of the gas in units of the mean density) because the velocities due to expansion always dominate the widths of the corresponding weak lines, and that the temperature measurement is increasingly ambiguous for gas with Δg{$>\sptilde$}5 because the dispersion in temperature at fixed density is high. From our observed spectra, the temperature is most precisely determined at densities slightly above the mean: T*=(20,200+/-2700,20,200+/-1300,22,600+/-1900) K (statistical error bars) for gas densities Δ*=(1.42+/-0.08,1.37+/-0.11,1.66+/-0.11) at redshift z=(3.9,3.0,2.4). Systematic errors in T* should be less than 2000 K. The power-law index of the temperature-density relation, defined by T=T*(Δg/Δ*)γ- 1, is γ-1=(0.43+/-0.45,0.29+/-0.30,0.52+/-0.14) for the same three redshifts. The temperature at fixed overdensity Δ=1.4 is T1.4=(20,100+/-2800,20,300+/-1400,20,700+/-1900) K. This unchanging temperature is higher than expected for photoionized gas in ionization equilibrium with a cosmic background. If the heat from the He II reionization is responsible for the high measured temperature, then the temperature should not be constant but should have a maximum at the end of the reionization epoch. We update the lower limit to the baryon density implied by the observed mean flux decrement. The observations were made at the W. M.

All the results are presented in tabular form, with full error covariance matrices, to allow for comparisons with any numerical simulations and with other data sets. The observations are compared with a numerical simulation of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of a ΛCDM model with Ω=0.4, known to agree with other large-scale structure observational constraints. There is excellent agreement for the TFPDF if the mean transmitted flux is adjusted to match the observations. A small difference between the observed and predicted TFPDF is found at high fluxes and low redshift, which may be due to the uncertain effects of fitting the spectral continuum. Using the numerical simulation, we show how the flux power spectrum can be used to recover the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations. From our sample of eight quasars, we measure the amplitude of the mass power spectrum to correspond to a linear variance per unit lnk of Δ2ρ(k)=0.72+/-0.09 at k=0.04(km s-1)-1 and z=3, and the slope of the power spectrum near the same k to be np=-2.55+/-0.10 (statistical error bars). The results are statistically consistent with those of Croft et al., although our value for the rms fluctuation is lower by a factor of 0.75.

  abstract = {We explore several physical effects on the power spectrum of the  Ly$\alpha$ forest transmitted flux. The effects we investigate here are not usually part of hydrodynamic simulations and so need to be estimated separately. The most important effect is that of high column density absorbers with damping wings, which add power on large scales. We compute their effect using the observational constraints on their abundance as a function of column density. Ignoring their effect leads to an underestimation of the slope of the linear theory power spectrum. The second effect we investigate is that of fluctuations in the ionizing radiation field. For this purpose we use a very large high-resolution N-body simulation, which allows us to simulate both the fluctuations in the ionizing radiation and the small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest within the same simulation. We find an enhancement of power on large scales for quasars and a suppression for galaxies. The strength of the effect rapidly increases with increasing redshift, allowing it to be uniquely identified in cases where it is significant. We develop templates that can be used to search for this effect as a function of quasar lifetime, quasar luminosity function and attenuation length. Finally, we explore the effects of galactic winds using hydrodynamic simulations. We find the wind effects on the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum to be degenerate with parameters related to the temperature of the gas that are already marginalized over in cosmological fits. While more work is needed to conclusively exclude all possible systematic errors, our results suggest that, in the context of data analysis procedures, where parameters of the Ly$\alpha$ forest model are properly marginalized over, the flux power spectrum is a reliable tracer of cosmological information.},

These faint galaxies, however, are very rich in gas; adding in the gas mass and plotting the baryonic disk mass Md=M*+Mgas in place of luminosity restores the single linear relation.

  abstract = {A number of radio interferometers are currently being planned or constructed to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not only will such measurements provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also traces the distribution of matter in the universe, this signal can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three-dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three-dimensional 21 cm power spectrum. We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. Next, we consider three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the velocity field fluctuations in the signal, and (3) looking at the signal at large enough scales that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a 2 yr observation with the second-generation interferometer MWA5000 in combination with the CMB telescope Planck could improve constraints on Ωw, Ωmh2, Ωbh2, Ων, ns, and $\alpha$s. If the universe is substantially ionized by z\textasciitilde 12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological parameters with any of the considered methods.},

The measurement of 3D correlations has the potential to improve constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters, ionizing background models and the re-ionization history. This study addresses the sensitivity of spectroscopic surveys to 3D correlations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We show that the sensitivity of a survey to this signal can be quantified by just a single number, a noise-weighted number density of sources on the sky. We investigate how the sensitivity of a spectroscopic quasar (or galaxy) survey scales as a function of its depth, area and redshift. We propose a simple method for weighting sightlines with varying signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) levels to estimate the correlation function, and we show that this estimator generally performs nearly as well as the minimum-variance quadratic estimator. In addition, we show that the sensitivity of a quasar survey to the flux correlation function is generally maximized if it observes each field just long enough to achieve S/N ≈ 2 in a 1-Å pixel on an L* quasar while acquiring spectra for all quasars with L {$>$} L*: little is gained by integrating longer on the same targets or by including fainter quasars. We quantify how these considerations relate to constraints on the angular diameter distance, the curvature of space-time and the re-ionization history.},

It is found that this relation should roughly apply ∆z ̃ 1-2 after a reionization event, and this limiting behaviour has motivated the power-law parameterizations used in most analyses of the Ly $\alpha$ forest. This relation has been explained by using equations linearized in the baryonic overdensity (which does not address why a tight power-law relation holds over two decades in density) or by equating the photoheating rate with the cooling rate from cosmological expansion (which we show is incorrect). Previous explanations also did not address why recombination cooling and Compton cooling off of the cosmic microwave background, which are never negligible, do not alter the character of this relation. We provide an understanding for why a tight power-law relation arises for unshocked gas at all densities for which collisional cooling is unimportant. We also use our results to comment on (1) how quickly fluctuations in temperature redshift away after reionization processes, (2) how much shock heating occurs in the low-density intergalactic medium, and (3) how the temperatures of collapsing gas parcels evolve.},

Furthermore, we show that the properties of Lyman-limit systems in these simulations, in simple semianalytic arguments, and as suggested by recent observations indicate that a small change in the ionizing emissivity of the sources would have resulted in a much larger change in the amplitude of the intergalactic H I-ionizing background (with this scaling strengthening with increasing redshift). This strong scaling could explain the rapid evolution in the Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission observed at z ≈ 6. Our calculations agree with the suggestion of simpler models that the comoving ionizing emissivity was constant or even increasing from z = 3 to 6. Our calculations also provide a more rigorous estimate than in previous studies for the clumping factor of intergalactic gas after reionization, which we estimate was ≈2-3 at z = 6.},

We use high force resolution simulations to analyze the effects of galaxy bias on the measurements of the BAO signal. We apply a variety of Halo Occupation Distributions (HODs) and produce biased mass tracers to mimic different galaxy populations. We investigate whether galaxy bias changes the nonlinear shifts on the acoustic scale relative to the underlying dark matter distribution presented by Seo et al. For the less biased HOD models (b 3) show a shift at moderate significance (0.79\% ± 0.31\% for the most extreme case). We test the one-step reconstruction technique introduced by Eisenstein et al. in the case of realistic galaxy bias and shot noise. The reconstruction scheme increases the correlation between the initial and final (z = 1) density fields, achieving an equivalent level of correlation at nearly twice the wavenumber after reconstruction. Reconstruction reduces the shifts and errors on the shifts. We find that after reconstruction the shifts from the galaxy cases and the dark matter case are consistent with each other and with no shift. The 1σ systematic errors on the distance measurements inferred from our BAO measurements with various HODs after reconstruction are about 0.07\%-0.15\%.},

The statistics of the fluctuations are well reproduced by numerical gravity-hydrodynamics simulations within the context of standard cosmological structure formation scenarios. Thus, the study of the IGM offers an opportunity to probe the nature of the primordial density fluctuations on scales unavailable to other methods. The simulations also suggest that the IGM is the dominant reservoir of baryons produced by the Big Bang, and so the principal source of the matter from which galaxies formed. The detection of metal systems within the IGM shows that it was enriched by evolved stars early in its history, demonstrating an intimate connection between galaxy formation and the IGM. A comprehensive review of the current understanding of the structure and physical properties of the IGM and its relation to galaxies is presented, concluding with comments on prospects for furthering the study of the IGM using future ground-based facilities and space-based experiments.},

We show that the shot noise in the power spectrum due to discrete sources is strongly suppressed relative to the steady-state value at low wavenumbers by a factor proportional to the lifetime of the sources, and that this suppression may be used to constrain QSO lifetimes. The total H I Ly $\alpha$ power spectrum including shot noise is affected at tens of per cent on short scales and by as much as an order of magnitude or more on scales exceeding the mean free path. The spatial correlation function is similarly found to be sensitive to the shot noise, although moderately insensitive to the effects of time dependence on the non-shot-noise contribution. Photoionization rate fluctuations substantially modify the shape of the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak in the correlation function, including a small increase in its position that must be accounted for to avoid biasing estimates of cosmological parameters based on the peak position. We briefly investigate solving the full frequency-dependent equation, finding that it agrees with the frequency-independent to better than per cent accuracy. Simple formulas are provided for the power spectrum of fluctuations in the photoionization rate that approximate the full computations.},

We couple Galacticus to three different dust attenuation methods and examine the counts using each method. A \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ minimisation approach is used to compare the model predictions to observed galaxy counts and calibrate the dust parameters. We find that weak dust attenuation is required for the Galacticus counts to be broadly consistent with the observations, though the optimum dust parameters return large values for \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$, suggesting that further calibration of Galacticus is necessary. The model predictions are also consistent with observed estimates for the optical depth and the H\$\textbackslash alpha\$ luminosity function.

This changes the implied correlations in the absorption and in particular makes the Ly $\alpha$ forest correlation function, or power spectrum, locally anisotropic in the plane of the sky. We have proposed a method for measuring weak lensing using this effect. Here, we estimate the noise expected in weak lensing maps and power spectra for different sets of observational parameters. We find that surveys of the size and quality of the ones being done today and ones planned for the future will be able to measure the lensing power spectrum at a source redshift of z ≃ 2.5 with high precision and even be able to image the distribution of foreground matter with high fidelity on degree scales. For example, we predict that Ly $\alpha$ forest lensing measurements from the DESI and WEAVE surveys should yield the mass fluctuation amplitude with a statistical error of ̃3 per cent, eBOSS ̃6 per cent. and the proposed MSE survey less than 1 per cent. By dividing the redshift range into multiple bins, some tomographic lensing information should be accessible as well. This would allow for cosmological lensing measurements at higher redshift than are accessible with galaxy shear surveys and correspondingly better constraints on the evolution of dark energy at relatively early times.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a method for reconstructing the weak lensing potential from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. We derive an optimal estimator for the lensing potential on the sky based on the correlation between pixels in real space. This method effectively deals with irregularly spaced data, holes in the survey, missing data, and inhomogeneous noise. We demonstrate an implementation of the method with simulated spectra and weak lensing. It is shown that with a source density of ≳0.5 per square arcmin and ∼200 pixels in each spectrum (λ/Δλ = 1300) the lensing potential can be reconstructed with high fidelity if the relative absorption in the spectral pixels is signal dominated. When noise dominates the measurement of the absorption in each pixel the noise in the lensing potential is higher, but for reasonable numbers of sources and noise levels and a high fidelity map the lensing potential is obtainable. The lensing estimator could also be applied to lensing of the cosmic microwave background, 21 cm intensity mapping, or any case in which the correlation function of the source can be accurately estimated.},

  abstract = {The average rate of emission of ionizing radiation per unit volume (or  emissivity) in the universe can be calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the ionizing background to the mean free path of ionizing photons. The intensity of the background is measured from the mean transmitted flux of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, and the mean free path is measured from the abundance of Lyman limit systems, which has been observed so far up to z=4. This yields an emissivity that is not larger than seven ionizing photons per Hubble time for each atom in the universe at z=4, which may reasonably arise from QSOs and star-forming galaxies. In order for the reionization to end by z=6, and assuming that the clumping factor of ionized gas during the reionization epoch is close to unity, this ionizing comoving emissivity cannot decline from z=4 up to z\textasciitilde 9 by more than a factor 1.5. If the clumping factor were much larger than unity, then the emissivity would need to rapidly increase with redshift. Unless the ionizing emissivity increases substantially from z=4 to z\textasciitilde 10-20, the Thomson optical depth to the cosmic microwave background must be in the range 0.045{$<$}τ{$<$}0.09.},

  abstract = {We use an Eulerian hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to model the  Ly$\alpha$ forest in a spatially flat, COBE-normalized, cold dark matter model with \{OMEGA\} = 0.4. We find that the intergalactic, photoionized gas is predicted to collapse into sheetlike and filamentary structures which give rise to absorption lines having characteristics similar to the observed Ly$\alpha$ forest. A typical filament is \textasciitilde 500 h\^-1\^ kpc long with thickness \textasciitilde 50 h\^-1\^ kpc (in proper units), and baryonic mass \textasciitilde 10\^10\^ h\^- 1\^ M\_sun\_. In comparison our cell size is (2.5,9)h\^-1\^ kpc in the two simulations we perform, with true resolution perhaps a factor of 2.5 worse than this. The gas temperature is in the range 10\^4\^-10\^5\^ K, and it increases with time as structures with larger velocities collapse gravitationally. We show that the predicted distributions of column densities, b-parameters, and equivalent widths of the Ly$\alpha$ forest clouds agree reasonably with observations, and that their evolution is consistent with the observed evolution, if the ionizing background has an approximately constant intensity between z = 2 and z = 4. A new method of identifying lines as contiguous regions in the spectrum below a fixed flux threshold is suggested to analyze the absorption lines, given that the Ly$\alpha$ spectra arise from a continuous density field of neutral hydrogen rather than discrete clouds. We also predict the distribution of transmitted flux and its correlation along a spectrum and on parallel spectra, and the He II flux decrement as a function of redshift. We predict a correlation length of \textasciitilde 80 h\^-1\^ kpc perpendicular to the line of sight for features in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. In order to reproduce the observed number of lines and average flux transmission, the baryon content of the clouds may need to be significantly higher than in previous models because of the low densities and large volume-filling factors we predict. If the background intensity J\_H I\_ is at least that predicted from the observed quasars, \{OMEGA\}\_b\_ needs to be as high as \textasciitilde 0.25 h\^-2\^. The model also predicts that most of the baryons at z {$>$} 2 are in Ly$\alpha$ clouds, and that the rate at which the baryons move to more overdense regions is slow. A large fraction of the baryons which are not observed at present in galaxies might be intergalactic gas in the currently collapsing structures, with T\textasciitilde 10\^5\^- 10\^6\^ K. All our results on the statistical properties of the simulated spectra are predictions that can be directly tested by applying the same methods to observed spectra. We are making the simulated spectra electronically available.},

For cosmological use, accurate redshifts are needed among other characteristics; however the vast majority of the SN will not have spectroscopic redshifts, even for their host galaxies, only photometric redshifts. We assess the redshift systematic control necessary for robust cosmology. Based on the photometric vs true redshift relation generated by machine learning applied to a simulation of 500,000 galaxies as observed with LSST quality, we quantify requirements on systematics in the mean relation and in the outlier fraction and deviance so as not to bias dark energy cosmological inference. Certain redshift ranges are particularly sensitive, motivating spectroscopic followup of SN at \$z\textbackslash lesssim0.2\$ and around \$z\textbackslash approx0.5\$-0.6. Including Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope near infrared bands in the simulation, we reanalyze the constraints, finding improvements at high redshift but little at the low redshifts where systematics lead to strong cosmology bias. We identify a complete spectroscopic survey of SN host galaxies for \$z\textbackslash lesssim0.2\$ as a highly favored element for robust SN cosmology.},

Neutral hydrogen is assigned to halos using three prescriptions, and we investigate the clustering in real and redshift-space at the 2-point level. In common with earlier work we find the bias of HI increases from near 2 at z=2 to 4 at z=6, becoming more scale dependent at high z. The level of scale-dependence and decorrelation with the matter field are as predicted by perturbation theory. Due to the low mass of the hosting halos, the impact of fingers of god is small on the range relevant for proposed 21-cm instruments. We show that baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions could be well measured by such instruments. Taking advantage of the large simulation volume, we assess the impact of fluctuations in the ultraviolet background, which change HI clustering primarily at large scales. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

Mechanical limitations of the fibre-fed spectrograph on the Sloan telescope prevent two fibres being placed closer than 62 arcsec in a single pass of the instrument. These 'fibre collisions' strongly correlate with the intrinsic clustering of targets and can bias measurements of the two-point correlation function resulting in a systematic error on the inferred values of the cosmological parameters. We combine the new techniques of pairwise-inverse probability and the angular upweighting (PIP+ANG) to correct the clustering measurements for the effect of fibre collisions. Using mock catalogues, we show that our corrections provide unbiased measurements, within data precision, of both the projected \$\textbackslash rm \{\textbackslash mathit\{ w\}\_p\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash mathit\{ r\}\_p\textbackslash right)\$ and the redshift-space multipole ξ(ℓ = 0, 2, 4)(s) correlation functions down to \$0.1\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ , regardless of the tracer type. We apply the corrections to the eBOSS DR16 catalogues. We find that, on scales \$s\textbackslash gtrsim 20\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ for ξℓ, as used to make baryon acoustic oscillation and large-scale redshift-space distortion measurements, approximate methods such as nearest-neighbour upweighting are sufficiently accurate given the statistical errors of the data. Using the PIP method, for the first time for a spectroscopic program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we are able to successfully access the one-halo term in the clustering measurements down to \$\textbackslash sim 0.1\textbackslash, h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ scales. Our results will therefore allow studies that use the small-scale clustering to strengthen the constraints on both cosmological parameters and the halo occupation distribution models.},

  abstract = {We used the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) final  data release (PDR-2) to investigate the performance of colour-selected populations of galaxies as tracers of linear large-scale motions. We empirically selected volume-limited samples of blue and red galaxies as to minimise the systematic error on the estimate of the growth rate of structure fσ8 from the anisotropy of the two-point correlation function. To this end, rather than rigidly splitting the sample into two colour classes we defined the red or blue fractional contribution of each object through a weight based on the (U - V ) colour distribution. Using mock surveys that are designed to reproduce the observed properties of VIPERS galaxies, we find the systematic error in recovering the fiducial value of fσ8 to be minimised when using a volume-limited sample of luminous blue galaxies. We modelled non-linear corrections via the Scoccimarro extension of the Kaiser model (with updated fitting formulae for the velocity power spectra), finding systematic errors on fσ8 of below 1-2\%, using scales as small as 5 h-1 Mpc. We interpret this result as indicating that selection of luminous blue galaxies maximises the fraction that are central objects in their dark matter haloes; this in turn minimises the contribution to the measured ξ(rp,π) from the 1-halo term, which is dominated by non-linear motions. The gain is inferior if one uses the full magnitude-limited sample of blue objects, consistent with the presence of a significant fraction of blue, fainter satellites dominated by non-streaming, orbital velocities. We measured a value of fσ8 = 0.45 ± 0.11 over the single redshift range 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 1.0, corresponding to an effective redshift for the blue galaxies ⟨z⟩=0.85. Including in the likelihood the potential extra information contained in the blue-red galaxy cross-correlation function does not lead to an appreciable improvement in the error bars, while it increases the systematic error.

  abstract = {We study correlated fluctuations of Type Ia supernova observables due to peculiar velocities of both the observer and the supernova host galaxies, and their impact on cosmological parameter estimation. We aim to demonstrate using the CosmicFlows-3 dataset that at low redshifts the corrections for peculiar velocities in the JLA catalogue have been systematically underestimated. By querying a horizon-size N-body simulation we find that compared to a randomly placed observer, an observer in an environment like our local Universe will see 2-8 times stronger correlations between supernovae in the JLA catalogue. Hence the covariances usually employed underestimate the effects of coherent motion of the supernova host galaxies. Contrary to previous studies which asserted that peculiar velocities have negligible effect on cosmological parameter estimation, we find that when such correlations are taken into account the JLA data favour significantly smaller values of the dark energy density than in the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. A joint fit to simultaneously determine the cosmological parameters and the bulk flow indicates that the latter is around 250 km/s even beyond 200/h Mpc. The local bulk flow is thus an essential nuisance parameter to be included in analyses of the supernova Hubble diagram.},

For this analysis, we use the photometric classification framework SuperNNova (SNN; M\textbackslash "oller et al. 2019) trained on realistic DES-like simulations. For reliable classification, we process the DES SN programme (DES-SN) data and introduce improvements to the classifier architecture, obtaining classification accuracies of more than 98 per cent on simulations. This is the first SN classification to make use of ensemble methods, resulting in more robust samples.

We find good agreement between the light-curve properties of the photometrically-selected sample and simulations. Additionally, we create similar SN Ia samples using two types of Bayesian Neural Network classifiers that provide uncertainties on the classification probabilities. We test the feasibility of using these uncertainties as indicators for out-of-distribution candidates and model confidence.

  abstract = {We introduce SuperNNova, an open-source supernova photometric  classification framework that leverages recent advances in deep neural networks. Our core algorithm is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is trained to classify light curves using only photometric information. Additional information such as host-galaxy redshift can be incorporated to improve performance. We evaluate our framework using realistic supernova simulations that include survey detection. We show that our method, for the type Ia versus non-Ia supernova classification problem, reaches accuracies greater than 96.92 ± 0.09 without any redshift information and up to 99.55 ± 0.06 when redshift, either photometric or spectroscopic, is available. Further, we show that our method attains unprecedented performance for the classification of incomplete light curves, reaching accuracies {$>$}86.4 ± 0.1 ({$>$}93.5 ± 0.8) without host-galaxy redshift (with redshift information) 2 d before maximum light. In contrast with previous methods, there is no need for time-consuming feature engineering and we show that our method scales to very large data sets with a modest computing budget. In addition, we investigate often neglected pitfalls of machine learning algorithms. We show that commonly used algorithms suffer from poor calibration and overconfidence on out-of-distribution samples when applied to supernova data. We devise extensive tests to estimate the robustness of classifiers and cast the learning procedure under a Bayesian light, demonstrating a much better handling of uncertainties. We study the benefits of Bayesian RNNs for SN Ia cosmology. Our code is open sourced and available on github1.},

  abstract = {The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at high redshifts is a powerful probe of reionization. Modelling and observing this imprint comes with significant technical challenges: inhomogeneous reionization must be taken into account while simultaneously being able to resolve the web-like small-scale structure prior to reionization. In this work, we quantify the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at lower redshifts (2 \&lt; z \&lt; 4), where upcoming surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument will enable precision measurements of the flux power spectrum. We use both small box simulations capable of handling the small-scale structure of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and seminumerical large box simulations capable of representing the effects of inhomogeneous reionization. We find that inhomogeneous reionization could produce a measurable effect on the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum. The deviation in the 3D power spectrum at z\textsubscript{obs} = 4 and k = 0.14 Mpc\^\{-1\} ranges from 19 to 36 per cent, with a larger effect for later reionization. The corrections decrease to 2.0-4.1 per cent by z\textsubscript{obs} = 2. The impact on the 1D power spectrum is smaller, and ranges from 3.3-6.5 per cent at z\textsubscript{obs} = 4 to 0.35-0.75 per cent at z\textsubscript{obs} = 2, values which are comparable to the statistical uncertainties in current and upcoming surveys. Furthermore, we study how can this systematic be constrained with the help of the quadrupole of the 21 cm power spectrum.},

Fast-growing LRGs assemble 80\% of their stellar mass very early on (z̃ 5), whereas slow-growing LRGs reach the same evolutionary state at z̃ 1.5. Further investigation reveals that their clustering properties on scales of ̃1-30 Mpc are, at a high level of significance, also different. Fast-growing LRGs are found to be more strongly clustered and reside in overall denser large-scale structure environments than slow-growing systems, for a given stellar-mass threshold. Our results show a dependence of clustering on a property that is directly related to the evolution of galaxies, I.e., the stellar-mass assembly history, for a homogeneous population of similar mass and color.

The method, which follows an unbinned maximum likelihood approach, allows the deconvolution of the intrinsic CMASS colour-colour-magnitude distributions from photometric errors and selection effects. This procedure requires modelling the covariance matrix for the I-band magnitude, g - r colour and r - I colour using Stripe 82 multi-epoch data. Our results indicate that the error-deconvolved intrinsic RS distribution is consistent, within the photometric uncertainties, with a single point (\&lt;0.05 mag) in the colour-colour plane at fixed magnitude, for a narrow redshift slice. We have computed the high-mass end (\textsuperscript{0.55}M\textsubscript{I} ≲ -22) of the \textsuperscript{0.55}I-band RS luminosity function (RS LF) in several redshift slices within the redshift range 0.52 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.63.

We report RS completeness as a function of magnitude and redshift in the CMASS sample, which will facilitate a variety of galaxy-evolution and clustering studies using BOSS.

With a side length of 205 \$h\^\{-1\}\$Mpc and significant improvements on the sub-grid model with respect to the previous Illustris boxes, IllustrisTNG300 allows us to explore the dependencies of galaxy clustering over a large cosmological volume and wide halo-mass range. We show, at high statistical significance, that the halo assembly bias signal (i.e., the secondary dependence of halo bias on halo formation redshift) manifests itself on the clustering of the central galaxy population when this is split by stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate, and surface density. A significant detection is also obtained for galaxy size: at fixed halo mass, larger central galaxies are more tightly clustered than smaller central galaxies in haloes of mass M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\} \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{12.5\}\$ \$h\^\{-1\}\$M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. This effect, however, seems to be uncorrelated with halo formation time, unlike the rest of the secondary dependencies analysed. We also explore the transmission of the halo spin bias signal, i.e., the secondary dependence of halo bias on halo spin. Although galaxy spin retains little information about the total spin of the halo, the correlation is enough to produce a significant galaxy spin bias signal. We discuss possible ways to probe the spin bias effects with observations.},

We show that MTOE provides more accurate measurements than the standard technique of Feldman, Kaiser \& Peacock (FKP), independently of the tracer-selection strategy adopted, on both small and large scales. The largest improvements on individual P\^\{(0)\}\_$\alpha$ (k) are obtained on small scales, using a colour-magnitude selection, due to MTOE being naturally better equipped to deal with shot noise: we report an average error reduction with respect to FKP of ∼ 30 per cent at 0.3 {$<$} k [h Mpc-1] {$<$} 0.5, with improvements exceeding 40-50 per cent for some tracers. On large scales (k[h Mpc-1] ≲ 0.1), the gain in accuracy resulting from cosmic-variance cancellation is ∼10 per cent for the ratios of P\^\{(0)\}\_$\alpha$ (k). We have carried out a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to determine the impact of these gains on several quantities derived from P\^\{(0)\}\_$\alpha$ (k). If we pushthat the estimated power spectra are themselves the measurement to scales 0.3 {$<$} k [h Mpc-1] {$<$} 0.5, the average improvements are ∼ 30 per cent for the amplitudes of the monopoles, ∼ 75 per cent for the monopole ratios, and ∼ 20 per cent for the linear galaxy biases. Our results highlight the potential of MTOE to shed light upon the physics that operate both on large and small cosmological scales. The effect of MTOE on cosmological constraints using VIPERS data will be addressed in a separate paper.},

We split the clusters into two subsamples with different mean projected radial distances of their members, \&lt; \{R\}\textsubscript{\{\{mem\vphantom{\}\}}}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\&gt; , at fixed richness and redshift. The sample with smaller \&lt; \{R\}\textsubscript{\{\{mem\vphantom{\}\}}}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\&gt; has a smaller ratio of the splashback radius to the traditional halo boundary \{R\}\textsubscript{\{\{200m\vphantom{\}\}}}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\} than the subsample with larger \&lt; \{R\}\textsubscript{\{\{mem\vphantom{\}\}}}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\&gt; , indicative of different mass accretion rates for these subsamples. The same subsamples were recently used by Miyatake et al. to show that their large-scale clustering differs despite their similar weak lensing masses, demonstrating strong evidence for halo assembly bias. We expand on this result by presenting a 6.6σ difference in the clustering amplitudes of these samples using cluster-photometric galaxy cross-correlations. This measurement is a clear indication that halo clustering depends on parameters other than halo mass. If \&lt; \{R\}\textsubscript{\{\{mem\vphantom{\}\}}}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\&gt; is related to the mass assembly history of halos, the measurement is a manifestation of the halo assembly bias. However, our measured splashback radii are smaller, while the strength of the assembly bias signal is stronger, than the predictions of collisionless Λ cold dark matter simulations. We show that dynamical friction, cluster mis-centering, or projection effects are not likely to be the sole source of these discrepancies. However, further investigations regarding unknown catastrophic weak lensing or cluster identification systematics are warranted.},

  abstract = {We present new improved constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z) in the  redshift range 0.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopic evolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. We extract a large sample of early-type galaxies ( \textasciitilde{} 11000) from several spectroscopic surveys, spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.42). We select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as standard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by Jimenez \& Loeb (2002), whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes H(z). We analyze the 4000 Å break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors. We provide 8 new measurements of H(z) (see table 4), and determine its change in H(z) to a precision of 5-12\% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z \textasciitilde{} 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z≠0 with a precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6\% at z \textasciitilde{} 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.8) which is crucial to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have been tested to best match a ΛCDM model, clearly providing a statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. This method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constrain a variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g. Euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \textasciitilde{} 2.}

  abstract = {Deriving the expansion history of the Universe is a major goal of modern cosmology. To date, the most accurate measurements have been obtained with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), providing evidence for the existence of a transition epoch at which the expansion rate changes from decelerated to accelerated. However, these results have been obtained within the framework of specific cosmological models that must be implicitly or explicitly assumed in the measurement. It is therefore crucial to obtain measurements of the accelerated expansion of the Universe independently of assumptions on cosmological models. Here we exploit the unprecedented statistics provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS, [1-3]) Data Release 9 to provide new constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z) using the cosmic chronometers approach. We extract a sample of more than 130000 of the most massive and passively evolving galaxies, obtaining five new cosmology-independent H(z) measurements in the redshift range 0.3 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.5, with an accuracy of \textasciitilde 11-16\% incorporating both statistical and systematic errors. Once combined, these measurements yield a 6\% accuracy constraint of H(z = 0.4293) = 91.8 ± 5.3 km/s/Mpc. The new data are crucial to provide the first cosmology-independent determination of the transition redshift at high statistical significance, measuring z\textsubscript{t} = 0.4 ± 0.1, and to significantly disfavor the null hypothesis of no transition between decelerated and accelerated expansion at 99.9\% confidence level. This analysis highlights the wide potential of the cosmic chronometers approach: it permits to derive constraints on the expansion history of the Universe with results competitive with standard probes, and most importantly, being the estimates independent of the cosmological model, it can constrain cosmologies beyond—and including—the ΛCDM model. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

In this letter are presented two new measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z) obtained with the cosmic chronometer method up to z ̃ 2. Taking advantage of near-infrared spectroscopy of the few very massive and passive galaxies observed at z \&gt; 1.4 available in literature, the differential evolution of this population is estimated and calibrated with different stellar population synthesis models to constrain H(z), including in the final error budget all possible sources of systematic uncertainties (star formation history, stellar metallicity, model dependences). This analysis is able to extend significantly the redshift range coverage with respect to present-day constraints, crossing for the first time the limit at z ̃ 1.75. The new H(z) data are used to estimate the gain in accuracy on cosmological parameters with respect to previous measurements in two cosmological models, finding a small but detectable improvement (̃5 per cent) in particular on Ω\textsubscript{M} and w\textsubscript{0}. Finally, a simulation of a Euclid-like survey has been performed to forecast the expected improvement with future data. The provided constraints have been obtained just with the cosmic chronometers approach, without any additional data, and the results show the high potentiality of this method to constrain the expansion history of the Universe at these redshifts.},

We then discuss the current observational state of the field, with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SN), direct measurements of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$), and measurements of galaxy and matter clustering. Assuming a flat universe and dark energy with a constant equation-of-state parameter \$w = P/\textbackslash rho\$, the combination of Planck CMB temperature anisotropies, WMAP CMB polarization, the Union2.1 SN compilation, and a compilation of BAO measurements yields \$w = -1.10\^\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.07\}\$, consistent with a cosmological constant (\$w=-1\$). However, with these constraints the cosmological constant model predicts a value of \$H\_0\$ that is lower than several of the leading recent estimates, and it predicts a parameter combination \$\textbackslash sigma\_8(\textbackslash Omega\_m)\^\{0.5\}\$ that is higher than many estimates from weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift-space distortions. Individually these tensions are only significant at the \textasciitilde\$2\textbackslash sigma\$ level, but they arise in multiple data sets with independent statistics and distinct sources of systematic uncertainty. The tensions are stronger with Planck CMB data than they were with WMAP because of the smaller statistical errors and the higher central value of \$\textbackslash Omega\_m.\$ With the improved measurements expected from the next generation of data sets, these tensions may diminish, or they may sharpen in a way that points towards a more complete physical understanding of cosmic acceleration.},

Unlike the SH0ES team, we do not enforce a universal color-luminosity relation to correct the near-IR Cepheid magnitudes. Instead, we focus on a data driven method, where the measured colors of the Cepheids are used to derive a color-luminosity relation for each galaxy individually. We present two different analyses, one based on Wesenheit magnitudes, a common practice in the field that attempts to combine corrections from both extinction and variations in intrinsic colors, resulting in \$H\_0=66.9\textbackslash pm 2.5\$ km/s/Mpc, in agreement with the Planck value. In the second approach, we calibrate using color excesses with respect to derived average intrinsic colors, yielding \$H\_0=71.8\textbackslash pm 1.6\$ km/s/Mpc, a \$2.7\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$ tension with the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Hence, we argue that systematic uncertainties related to the choice of Cepheid color-luminosity calibration method currently inhibits us from measuring \$H\_0\$ to the precision required to claim a substantial tension with Planck data.},

This validation includes residuals from the light curve training process, systematic biases in SN Ia distance measurements, and the bias on the dark energy equation of state parameter w. Using the SN-analysis package SNANA, we simulate and analyze realistic samples corresponding to the data samples used in the SNLS3 analysis: 120 low-redshift (z {$<$} 0.1) SNe Ia, 255 SDSS SNe Ia (z {$<$} 0.4), and 290 SNLS SNe Ia (z {$<$}= 1). To probe systematic uncertainties in detail, we vary the input spectral model, the model of intrinsic scatter, and the smoothing (i.e., regularization) parameters used during the SALT-II model training. Using realistic intrinsic scatter models results in a slight bias in the ultraviolet portion of the trained SALT-II model, and w biases (winput - wrecovered) ranging from -0.005 +/- 0.012 to -0.024 +/- 0.010.

  abstract = {Since the launch of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 9 yr ago, Cepheid distances to 25 galaxies have been determined for the purpose of calibrating secondary distance indicators. Eighteen of these have been measured by the HST Key Project team, six by the Supernova Calibration Project, and one independently by Tanvir. Collectively, this work sets out an array of survey markers over the region within 25 Mpc of the Milky Way. A variety of secondary distance indicators can now be calibrated, and the accompanying four papers employ the full set of 25 galaxies to consider the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, Type Ia supernovae, and surface brightness fluctuations. When calibrated with Cepheid distances, each of these methods yields a measurement of the Hubble constant and a corresponding measurement uncertainty. We combine these measurements in this paper, together with a model of the velocity field, to yield the best available estimate of the value of H0 within the range of these secondary distance indicators and its uncertainty. The uncertainty in the result is modeled in an extensive simulation we call the ``virtual Key Project.'' The velocity-field model includes the influence of the Virgo cluster, the Great Attractor, and the Shapley supercluster, but does not play a significant part in determining the result. The result is H0=71+/-6 km s-1 Mpc-1. The largest contributor to the uncertainty of this 67\% confidence level result is the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has been assumed to be 50+/-3 kpc. This takes up the first 6.5\% of our 9\% error budget. Other contributors are the photometric calibration of the WFPC2 instrument, which takes up 4.5\%, deviations from uniform Hubble flow in the volume sampled ({$<\sptilde$}2\%), the composition sensitivity of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation (4\%), and departures from a universal reddening law (\textasciitilde 1\%). These are the major components that , when combined in quadrature, make up the 9\% total uncertainty. If the LMC distance modulus were systematically smaller by 1 σ than that adopted here, the derived value of the Hubble constant would increase by 4 km s-1 Mpc-1. Most of the significant systematic errors are capable of amelioration in future work. These include the uncertainty in the photometric calibration of WFPC2, the LMC distance, and the reddening correction. A NICMOS study is in its preliminary reduction phase, addressing the last of these concerns. Various empirical analyses have suggested that Cepheid distance moduli are affected by metallicity differences. If we adopted the composition sensitivity obtained in the Key Project's study of M101, and employed the oxygen abundances measured spectroscopically in each of the Cepheid fields we have studied, the value of the Hubble constant would be reduced by 4\%+/-2\% to 68+/-6 km s-1 Mpc-1.

We present constraints on several phenomenological models of modified gravity: First, we parametrize the growth of structure using the growth index γ, finding γ = 0.566 ± 0.058 (68 per cent C.L.). Secondly, we modify the relation of the two Newtonian potentials by introducing two additional parameters, GM and GL. In this approach, GM refers to modifications of the growth of structure whereas GL to modification of the lensing potential. We consider a power law to model the redshift dependence of GM and GL as well as binning in redshift space, introducing four additional degrees of freedom, GM(z {$<$} 0.5), GM(z {$>$} 0.5), GL(z {$<$} 0.5), and GL(z {$>$} 0.5). At 68 per cent C.L., we measure GM = 0.980 ± 0.096 and GL = 1.082 ± 0.060 for a linear model, GM = 1.01 ± 0.36 and GL = 1.31 ± 0.19 for a cubic model as well as GM(z {$<$} 0.5) = 1.26 ± 0.32, GM(z {$>$} 0.5) = 0.986 ± 0.022, GL(z {$<$} 0.5) = 1.067 ± 0.058, and GL(z {$>$} 0.5) = 1.037 ± 0.029. Thirdly, we investigate general scalar tensor theories of gravity, finding the model to be mostly unconstrained by current data. Assuming a one-parameter f(R) model, we can constrain B0 {$<$} 7.7 × 10-5 (95 per cent C.L). For all models we considered, we find good agreement with general relativity.},

The analysis focuses on using the mean pairwise velocity of clusters as observed through the kinematic SZ effect (kSZ), an approach based on the same methods used for the first detection of the kSZ effect, and includes a detailed derivation and discussion of this statistic’s covariance under a variety of different survey assumptions. The potential of current, Stage II, and upcoming, Stages III and IV, CMB observations are considered, in combination with contemporaneous spectroscopic and photometric galaxy observations. A detailed assessment is made of the sensitivity to the assumed statistical and systematic uncertainties in the optical depth determination, the magnitude and uncertainty in the minimum detectable mass, and the importance of pairwise velocity correlations at small separations, where nonlinear effects can start to arise. In combination with Stage III constraints on the expansion history, such as those projected by the Dark Energy Task Force, we forecast 5\% and 3\% for fractional errors on the growth factor, γ, for Stage III and IV surveys, respectively, and 2\% constraints on the growth rate, fg, for a Stage IV survey for 0.2\textbackslash lt z\textbackslash lt 0.6.

  abstract = {As part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will improve measurements of the cosmological distance scale by applying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method to quasar samples. eBOSS will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq. deg. First, a "CORE" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugriz using a likelihood-based routine called XDQSOz, with a mid-IR-optical color-cut. eBOSS CORE selection (to g {$<$} 22 OR r {$<$} 22) should return \textasciitilde{} 70 quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 and \textasciitilde 7 z {$>$} 2.1 quasars per sq. deg. Second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from the Palomar Transient Factory should recover an additional \textasciitilde 3-4 z {$>$} 2.1 quasars per sq. deg. to g {$<$} 22.5. A linear model of how imaging systematics affect target density recovers the angular distribution of eBOSS CORE quasars over 96.7\% (76.7\%) of the SDSS North (South) Galactic Cap area. The eBOSS CORE quasar sample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 to yield the first few-percent-level BAO constraint near z\textasciitilde 1.5. eBOSS quasars at z {$>$} 2.1 will be used to improve BAO measurements in the Lyman-alpha Forest. Beyond its key cosmological goals, eBOSS should be the next-generation quasar survey, comprising {$>$} 500,000 new quasars and {$>$} 500,000 uniformly selected spectroscopically confirmed 0.9 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 quasars. At the conclusion of eBOSS, the SDSS will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.},

We perform a joint fit to the data for redshift space distortions (RSD) due to galaxy peculiar velocities and anisotropies due to the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect, for the first time using a velocity field reconstruction technique to remove the complicating effects of RSD in the void center positions themselves. Fits to the void-galaxy function give a 1\% measurement of the AP parameter combination DA(z )H (z )/c =0.4367 ±0.0045 at redshift z =0.57 , where DA is the angular diameter distance and H the Hubble parameter, exceeding the precision obtainable from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by a factor of ˜3.5 and free of systematic errors. From voids alone we also obtain a 10\% measure of the growth rate, f σ8(z =0.57 )=0.501 ±0.051 . The parameter degeneracies are orthogonal to those obtained from galaxy clustering. Combining void information with that from BAO and galaxy RSD in the same CMASS sample, we measure DA(0.57 )/rs=9.383 ±0.077 (at 0.8\% precision), H (0.57 )rs=(14.05 ±0.14 )103 kms-1 Mpc-1 (1\%), and f σ8=0.453 ±0.022 (4.9\%), consistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from Planck. These represent a factor ˜2 improvement in precision over previous results through the inclusion of void information. Fitting a flat cosmological constant Λ CDM model to these results in combination with Planck CMB data, we find up to an 11\% reduction in uncertainties on H0 and Ωm compared to use of the corresponding BOSS consensus values. Constraints on extended models with nonflat geometry and a dark energy of state that differs from w =-1 show an even greater improvement.},

This sample consists of LRGs between redshifts 0.6 and 1.0, combined with the high redshift z {$>$} 0.6 tail of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 12 CMASS sample. We use a reconstruction method to undo redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects from the galaxy field before applying a watershed void-finding algorithm to remove bias from the void selection. We then perform a joint fit to the multipole moments of the correlation function for the growth rate fσ8 and the geometrical distance ratio DM/DH, finding \$f\textbackslash sigma \_8(z\_\textbackslash rm \{eff\})=0.356\textbackslash pm 0.079\$ and \$D\_M/D\_H(z\_\textbackslash rm \{eff\})=0.868\textbackslash pm 0.017\$ at the effective redshift \$z\_\textbackslash rm \{eff\}=0.69\$ of the sample. The posterior parameter degeneracies are orthogonal to those from galaxy clustering analyses applied to the same data, and the constraint achieved on DM/DH is significantly tighter. In combination with the consensus galaxy BAO and full-shape analyses of the same sample, we obtain fσ8 = 0.447 ± 0.039, DM/rd = 17.48 ± 0.23, and DH/rd = 20.10 ± 0.34.

  abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to assess the feasibility of constraining the thermal history of the intergalactic medium during reionization with the Ly$\alpha$ forest at z ≃ 5. The integrated thermal history has a measurable impact on the transmitted flux power spectrum that can be isolated from Doppler broadening at this redshift. We parametrize this using the cumulative energy per proton, u\textsubscript{0}, deposited into a gas parcel at the mean background density, a quantity that is tightly linked with the gas density power spectrum in the simulations. We construct mock observations of the line-of-sight Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum and use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to recover u\textsubscript{0} at redshifts 5 ≲ z ≲ 12. A statistical uncertainty of ̃20 per cent is expected (at 68 per cent confidence) at z ≃ 5 using high-resolution spectra with a total redshift path length of ∆z = 4 and a typical signal-to-noise ratio of 15 per pixel. Estimates for the expected systematic uncertainties are comparable, such that existing data should enable a measurement of u\textsubscript{0} to within ̃30 per cent. This translates to distinguishing between reionization scenarios with similar instantaneous temperatures at z ≃ 5, but with an energy deposited per proton that differs by 2-3 eV over the redshift interval 5 ≲ z ≲ 12. For an initial temperature of T ̃ 10\textsuperscript{4} K following reionization, this corresponds to the difference between early (z\textsubscript{re} = 12) and late (z\textsubscript{re} = 7) reionization in our models.},

Some of the classes included in the dataset are: supernovae, cataclysmic variables, active galactic nuclei, high proper motion stars, blazars and flares. As an example of the tasks that can be performed on the dataset we experiment with multiple data pre-processing methods, feature selection techniques and popular machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Neural Networks). We assess quantitative performance in two classification tasks: binary (transient/non-transient) and eight-class classification. The best performing algorithm in both tasks is the Random Forest Classifier. It achieves an F1-score of 96.25\% in the binary classification and 52.79\% in the eight-class classification. For the eight-class classification, non-transients ( 96.83\% ) is the class with the highest F1-score, while the lowest corresponds to high-proper-motion stars ( 16.79\% ); for supernovae it achieves a value of 54.57\% , close to the average across classes.

In this paper, we propose an analysis method that operates directly in the cosmology parameter space and varies the power spectrum template accordingly at each tested point. Predictions for the power spectrum multipoles from the TNS model are computed at different cosmologies in the framework of \$\textbackslash Lambda \textbackslash rm\{CDM\}\$. Applied to the final eBOSS QSO and LRG samples together with the low-z DR12 BOSS galaxy sample, our analysis results in a set of constraints on the cosmological parameters \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm cdm\}\$, \$H\_0\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm b\}\$ and \$n\_s\$. To reduce the number of computed models, we construct an iterative process to sample the likelihood surface, where each iteration consists of a Gaussian process regression. This method is validated with mocks from N-body simulations. From the combined analysis of the (e)BOSS data, we obtain the following constraints: \$\textbackslash sigma\_8=0.877\textbackslash pm 0.049\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}=0.304\^\{+0.016\}\_\{-0.010\}\$ without any external prior.

The sample contains \$343\textbackslash, 708\$ quasars between redshifts 0.8 ≤ z ≤ 2.2 over \$4699\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{deg\}\^2\$ . We calculate the Legendre multipoles (0,2,4) of the anisotropic power spectrum and perform a BAO and a Full-Shape (FS) analysis at the effective redshift zeff = 1.480. The errors include systematic errors that amount to 1/3 of the statistical error. The systematic errors comprise a modelling part studied using a blind N-body mock challenge and observational effects studied with approximate mocks to account for various types of redshift smearing and fibre collisions. For the BAO analysis, we measure the transverse comoving distance DM(zeff)/rdrag = 30.60 ± 0.90 and the Hubble distance DH(zeff)/rdrag = 13.34 ± 0.60. This agrees with the configuration space analysis, and the consensus yields: DM(zeff)/rdrag = 30.69 ± 0.80 and DH(zeff)/rdrag = 13.26 ± 0.55. In the FS analysis, we fit the power spectrum using a model based on Regularised Perturbation Theory, which includes redshift space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. The results are DM(zeff)/rdrag = 30.68 ± 0.90 and DH(zeff)/rdrag = 13.52 ± 0.51 and we constrain the linear growth rate of structure f(zeff)σ8(zeff) = 0.476 ± 0.047. Our results agree with the configuration space analysis. The consensus analysis of the eBOSS quasar sample yields: DM(zeff)/rdrag = 30.21 ± 0.79, DH(zeff)/rdrag = 3.23 ± 0.47, and f(zeff)σ8(zeff) = 0.462 ± 0.045 and is consistent with a flat ΛCDM cosmological model using Planck results.},

  abstract = {We describe the design and data analysis of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift  Survey, the densest and largest high-precision redshift survey of galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 1 completed to date. The survey was designed to conduct a comprehensive census of massive galaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down to absolute magnitude MB = -20 at z \textasciitilde{} 1 via \textasciitilde 90 nights of observation on the Keck telescope. The survey covers an area of 2.8 deg2 divided into four separate fields observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of R AB = 24.1. Objects with z {$<\sptilde$} 0.7 are readily identifiable using BRI photometry and rejected in three of the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z {$>$} 0.7 to be targeted \textasciitilde 2.5 times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately 60\% of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly 53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the targets that fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z \textasciitilde{} 1.45, where the [O II] 3727 Å doublet lies in the infrared. The DEIMOS 1200 line mm-1 grating used for the survey delivers high spectral resolution (R \textasciitilde{} 6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique internal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the DEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into one of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. This paper is intended as a handbook for users of the DEEP2 Data Release 4, which includes all DEEP2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for the DEEP2 DEIMOS data reduction pipelines. Extensive details are provided on object selection, mask design, biases in target selection and redshift measurements, the spec2d two-dimensional data-reduction pipeline, the spec1d automated redshift pipeline, and the zspec visual redshift verification process, along with examples of instrumental signatures or other artifacts that in some cases remain after data reduction. Redshift errors and catastrophic failure rates are assessed through more than 2000 objects with duplicate observations. Sky subtraction is essentially photon-limited even under bright OH sky lines; we describe the strategies that permitted this, based on high image stability, accurate wavelength solutions, and powerful B-spline modeling methods. We also investigate the impact of targets that appear to be single objects in ground-based targeting imaging but prove to be composite in Hubble Space Telescope data; they constitute several percent of targets at z \textasciitilde{} 1, approaching \textasciitilde 5\%-10\% at z {$>$} 1.5. Summary data are given that demonstrate the superiority of DEEP2 over other deep high-precision redshift surveys at z \textasciitilde{} 1 in terms of redshift accuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also provide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far. Based on observations taken at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, and on observations made with the NASA/ESO Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555, and from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopic redshift surveys offer great prospects for constraining the dark sector in cosmology. Future surveys will however be both deep and wide and will thus require an analysis in 3-dimensional spherical geometry. We review and compare several methods which have been proposed in the literature for this purpose, focusing in particular on implementations of the spherical harmonic tomography (SHT) power spectrum \$C\^\{i j\}\_\{l\}\$ and the spherical Fourier Bessel (SFB) power spectrum \$C\_\{l\} (k, k')\$. Using a Fisher analysis, we compare the forecasted constraints on cosmological parameters using these statistics. These constraints typically rely on approximations such as the Limber approximation and make specific choices in the numerical implementation of each statistic. Using a series of toy models, we explore the applicability of these approximations and study the sensitivity of the SHT and SFB statistics to the details of their implementation. In particular, we show that overlapping redshift bins may improve cosmological constraints using the SHT statistic when the number of bins is small, and that the SFB constraints are quite robust to changes in the assumed distance-redshift relation. We also find that the SHT can be tailored to be more sensitive to modes at redshifts close to the survey boundary, while the SFB appears better suited to capture information beyond the smooth shape of the power spectrum. In this context, we discuss the pros and cons of the different techniques and their impact on the design and analysis of future wide field spectroscopic surveys.},

  abstract = {In Montero-Dorta et al. 2017, we show that luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) at \$z\textbackslash sim0.55\$ can be divided into two groups based on their star formation histories. So-called fast-growing LRGs assemble \$80\textbackslash\%\$ of their stellar mass at \$z\textbackslash sim5\$, whereas slow-growing LRGs reach the same evolutionary state at \$z\textbackslash sim1.5\$. We further demonstrate that these two subpopulations present significantly different clustering properties on scales of \$\textbackslash sim1 - 30 \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$. Here, we measure the mean halo mass of each subsample using the galaxy-galaxy lensing technique, in the \$\textbackslash sim190\textbackslash deg\^2\$ overlap of the LRG catalogue and the CS82 and CFHTLenS shear catalogues. We show that fast- and slow-growing LRGs have similar lensing profiles, which implies that they live in haloes of similar mass: \$\textbackslash log\textbackslash left(M\_\{\textbackslash rm halo\}\^\{\textbackslash rm fast\}/h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash right) = 12.85\^\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.26\}\$ and \$\textbackslash log\textbackslash left(M\_\{\textbackslash rm halo\}\^\{\textbackslash rm slow\}/h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash right) =12.92\^\{+0.16\}\_\{-0.22\}\$. This result, combined with the clustering difference, suggests the existence of galaxy assembly bias, although the effect is too subtle to be definitively proven given the errors on our current weak-lensing measurement. We show that this can soon be achieved with upcoming surveys like DES.},

Tests with state-of-art cosmological simulations show that the positions of proto-halos are reconstructed accurately, without having to assume a background cosmology. The algorithm, which makes use of a mass estimate of the biased tracers, but is robust to errors in this estimation, recovers the shape and amplitude of the initial pair correlation function of the tracers, enabling sub-percent precision in the BAO distance scale that is not tied to a cosmological model. In principle, our algorithm also allows direct and independent determinations of the bias factor and the smearing scale, potentially providing new methods for breaking the degeneracy between the bias factor \$b\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$.},

We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for future photometric surveys. We find that particularly at high redshifts, \$z\textbackslash gtrsim 1.5\$, the signal to noise ratio can become of order 30.

Our full (non-statistical) sample, based on Data Release 9, comprises 12 081 systems with log N(H i) ≥ 20, out of which 6839 have log N(H i) ≥ 20.3. This is the largest DLA sample ever compiled, superseding that from SDSS-II by a factor of seven. Using a statistical sub-sample and estimating systematics from realistic mock data, we probe the N(H i) distribution at ⟨z⟩ = 2.5. Contrary to what is generally believed, the distribution extends beyond 1022 cm-2 with a moderate slope of index ≈-3.5. This result matches the opacity-corrected distribution observed at z = 0 surprisingly well. The cosmological mass density of neutral gas in DLAs is found to be ωgdla ≈ 10-3, evolving only mildly over the past 12 billion years.

We use a fully automatic procedure to identify DLAs and derive their column densities. The procedure is checked against the results of previous searches for DLAs in SDSS. We discuss the agreements and differences and show the robustness of our procedure. For each system, we obtain an accurate measurement of the absorber's redshift, the H I column density and the equivalent width of associated metal absorption lines, without any human intervention. We find 1426 absorbers with 2.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 5.2 with log N(H I) ≥ 20, out of which 937 systems have log N(H I) ≥ 20.3. This is the largest DLA sample ever built, made available to the scientific community through the electronic version of this paper. In the course of the survey, we discovered the intervening DLA with highest H I column density known to date with log N(H I) = 22.0±0.1. This single system provides a strong constraint on the high-end of the N(H I) frequency distribution now measured with high accuracy. We show that the presence of a DLA at the blue end of a QSO spectrum can lead to important systematic errors and propose a method to avoid them. This has important consequences for the measurement of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas at z \textasciitilde{} 2.2 and therefore on our understanding of galaxy evolution over the past 10 billion years. We find a significant decrease of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas in DLAs, Ω\_g\^DLA, from z = 4 to z = 2.2, consistent with the result of previous SDSS studies. However, and contrary to other SDSS studies, we find that Ω\_g\^DLA(z = 2.2) is about twice the value at z = 0. This implies that Ω\_g\^DLA keeps decreasing at z {$<$} 2.2.

Methods: We identify 77 DLAs/strong sub-DLAs, with log N(H I)≥ 20 and z\_abs {$>$}1.8, which have data that include redshifted H2 Lyman and/or Werner-band absorption lines. This sample of H I, H2 and metal line measurements, performed in an homogeneous manner, is more than twice as large as our previous sample (Ledoux et al. 2003) considering every system in which searches for H2 could be completed so far, including all non-detections. Results: H2 is detected in thirteen of the systems, which have molecular fractions of values between f ≃ 5×10-7 and f ≃ 0.1, where f = 2N(H2)/(2N(H2)+N(H I)). Upper limits are measured for the remaining 64 systems with detection limits of typically log N(H2)\textasciitilde 14.3, corresponding to log f {$<$} -5. We find that about 35\% of the DLAs with metallicities relative to solar [X/H] ≥ -1.3 (i.e., 1/20th solar), with X = Zn, S or Si, have molecular fractions log f {$>$} -4.5, while H2 is detected - regardless of the molecular fraction - in ˜ 50\% of them. In contrast, only about 4\% of the [X/H] {$<$} -1.3 DLAs have log f {$>$} -4.5. We show that the presence of H2 does not strongly depend on the total neutral hydrogen column density, although the probability of finding log f {$>$} -4.5 is higher for log N(H I) ≥ 20.8 than below this limit (19\% and 7\% respectively). The overall H2 detection rate in log N(H I) ≥ 20 DLAs is found to be about 16\% (10\% considering only log f {$>$} -4.5 detections) after correction for a slight bias towards large N(H I). There is a strong preference for H2-bearing DLAs to have significant depletion factors, [X/Fe] {$>$} 0.4. In addition, all H2-bearing DLAs have column densities of iron into dust grains larger than log N(Fe)\_dust\textasciitilde{} 14.7, and about 40\% of the DLAs above this limit have detected H2 lines with log f {$>$} -4.5. This demonstrates the importance of dust in governing the detectability of H2 in DLAs. Our extended sample supports neither the redshift evolution of the detection fraction of H2-bearing DLAs nor that of the molecular fraction in systems with H2 detections over the redshift range 1.8 {$<$} z\_abs ≤ 3.

  abstract = {Given the present distribution of mass tracing objects in an expanding universe, we develop and test a fast method for recovering their past orbits using the least action principle. In this method, termed FAM for fast action minimization, the orbits are expanded in a set of orthogonal time basis functions satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions at the initial and final times. The conjugate gradient method is applied to locate the extremum of the action in the space of the expansion coefficients of the orbits. The treecode gravity solver routine is used for computing the gravitational field appearing in the action and the potential field appearing in the gradient of the action. The time integration of the Lagrangian is done using Gaussian quadratures. FAM allows us to increase the number of galaxies over previous numerical action principle implementations by more than one order of magnitude. For example, orbits for the \textasciitilde 15000 IRAS PSCz galaxies can be recovered in \textasciitilde 12000 CPU seconds on a 400-MHz DEC-Alpha machine. FAM can recover the present peculiar velocities of particles and the initial fluctuations field. It successfully recovers the flow field down to cluster scales, where deviations of the flow from the Zel'dovich solution are significant. We also show how to recover orbits from the present distribution of objects in redshift space by direct minimization of a modified action, without iterating the solution between real and redshift spaces.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for recovering the underlying velocity field from an observed distribution of galaxies in redshift space. The method is based on a kinematic Zel'dovich relation between the velocity and density fields in redshift space. This relation is expressed in a differential equation slightly modified from the usual Poisson equation and which depends nontrivially on β = \{OMEGA\}\^0.6\^/b. The linear equation can be readily solved by standard techniques of separation of variables by means of spherical harmonics. One can also include a term describing the "rocket effect" discussed by Kaiser (1987). From this redshift space information alone, one can generate a prediction of the peculiar velocity field for each harmonic (l, m) as a function of distance. We note that for the quadrupole and higher order moments, the equation is a boundary value problem with solutions dependent on both the interior and exterior mass distribution. However, for a shell at distance r, the dipole, as well as the monopole, of the velocity field in the Local Group frame is fully determined by the interior mass distribution. This implies that the shear of the measured velocity field, when fitted to a dipole distortion, should be aligned and consistent with the gravity field inferred from the well determined local galaxy distribution. As a preliminary application we compute the velocity dipole of distant shells as predicted from the 1.2 Jy IRAS survey compared to the measured velocity dipole on shells, as inferred from a recent POTENT analysis. The coherence between the two fields is good, yielding a best estimate of β = 0.6 +/- 0.2.},

  abstract = {A quasi-linear method for recovering the growing mode of the initial fluctuations of a cosmological gravitating system from the present large-scale peculiar velocity of density field is presented and tested. A velocity-potential field is extracted from the observed velocities as in the POTENT procedure, or from the density as in the analysis of IRAS redshift surveys, assuming that the velocity field, smoothed on a scale of a few megaparsecs, is irrotational. Assuming the Zel'dovich approximation with no orbit crossing, the potential is traced back in time by integrating a simple differential equation in Eulerian space - the Zel'dovich-Bernoulli equation. The linear velocity and density fields are computed from the linear potential by differentiation. The method is demonstrated to reconstruct the initial conditions of an N-body simulation, recovering in particular the initial Gaussian distribution of densities; the initial hills are lower and the valleys are deeper than predicted by linear theory. Maps of the initial density field in the local cosmological neighborhood based on the POTENT and IRAS analysis are presented as an illustration of a possible application.},

Our results cover a large range of scales from ̃500 to ̃90 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. We compare these estimates with the expectations of the flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) standard cosmological model with parameters compatible with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 data. We use the MultiDark cosmological simulation, one of the largest N-body runs presently available, together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, to estimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloes and galaxy biases. We find that the ΛCDM model gives a reasonable description to the observed correlation functions at z ≈ 0.5, which is remarkably good agreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance of BOSS galaxies, does not have any free parameters. However, we find a ≳10 per cent deviation in the correlation functions for scales ≲ 1 and ̃10-40 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. A more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics from upcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. We also estimate that about 12 per cent of the `galaxies' in the abundance-matched sample are satellites inhabiting central haloes with mass M ≳ 10\textsuperscript{14} h\textsuperscript{-1} M\textsubscript{☉}. Using the MultiDark simulation, we also study the real-space halo bias b of the matched catalogue finding that b = 2.00 ± 0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtained using the measured BOSS-projected correlation function. Furthermore, the linear large-scale bias, defined using the extrapolated linear matter power spectrum, depends on the number density n of the abundance-matched sample as b = -0.048 - (0.594 ± 0.02)log\textsubscript{10}(n/ h\textsuperscript{3} Mpc\textsuperscript{-3}). Extrapolating these results to baryon acoustic oscillation scales, we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signal produced by non-linear evolution that leads to ̃2-4 per cent dips at ≳ 3σ level for wavenumbers k ≳ 0.1 h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} in the linear large-scale bias.},

We use measurements of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion σstar and stellar mass Mstar to perform a simple split into subsamples of galaxies. We show that the amplitude of the monopole and quadrupole moments of the power spectrum depend differently on σstar and Mstar, allowing us to split the galaxy sample into subsets with matching monopoles but significantly different quadrupoles on all scales. Combining data from the LOWZ and CMASS NGC galaxy samples, we find {$>$}5σ evidence for anisotropic bias on scales k{$<$}0.15 h Mpc-1. We also examine splits using other observed properties. For galaxy samples split using Mstar and projected size R0, we find no significant evidence of anisotropic bias. Galaxy samples selected using additional properties exhibit strongly varying degrees of anisotropic assembly bias, depending on which combination of properties is used to split into subsets. This may explain why previous searches for this effect using the Fundamental Plane found inconsistent results. We conclude that any selection of a galaxy sample that depends on σstar can give biased and incorrect Redshift Space Distortion measurements.},

Our method combines simple theoretical results with a realistic characterization of the survey to dramatically reduce noise in the covariance matrix. For example, with an investment of only \textasciitilde 1,000 CPU hours we can produce a model covariance matrix with noise levels that would otherwise require \textasciitilde 35,000 mocks. Non-Gaussian contributions to the model are calibrated against mock catalogs, after which the model covariance is found to be in impressive agreement with the mock covariance matrix. Since calibration of this method requires fewer mocks than brute force approaches, we believe that it could dramatically reduce the number of mocks required to analyse future surveys.},

  abstract = {With the upcoming sky survey with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope a great sample of type Ia supernovae will be observed, allowing for a precise mapping of the velocity structure of the universe. Since the source of peculiar velocities is variations in the density field, cosmological parameters related to the matter distribution can subsequently be extracted from the velocity power spectrum. One way to quantify this is through the angular power spectrum of radial peculiar velocities on spheres at different redshifts. We investigate how well this observable can be measured, despite the problems caused by areas with no information. To obtain a realistic distribution of supernovae, we create mock supernova catalogs by using a semi-analytical code for galaxy formation on the merger trees extracted from N-body simulations. We measure the cosmic variance in the velocity power spectrum by repeating the procedure many times for differently located observers, and vary different aspects of the analysis, such as the observer environment, to see how this affects the measurements. Our results confirm the findings from earlier studies regarding the precision with which the angular velocity power spectrum can be determined in the near future. This level of precision has been found to imply, that the angular velocity power spectrum from type Ia supernovae is competitive in its potential to measure parameters such as \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. This makes the peculiar velocity power spectrum from type Ia supernovae a promising new observable, which deserves further attention.},

We confirm that the acoustic peak traced by the dark matter is both broadened and shifted as structure forms, and that this shift is well described by second-order perturbation theory. These shifts persist for dark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias, with the shift (mostly) increasing with increasing bias. Extending our perturbation theory results to halos with simple two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and Eulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed shifts. In particular, we demonstrate that there are additional terms that contribute to the shift that are absent for the matter. At z=0 for currently favored cosmologies, the matter shows shifts of ∼0.5\%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic scale by ∼0.2\%, while b=2 halos shift it by ∼0.5\%; these shifts decrease by the square of the growth factor D(z) at higher redshifts. These results are easily generalized to galaxies within the halo model, where we show that simple galaxy models show marginally larger shifts than the correspondingly biased halos, due to the contribution of satellites in high mass halos. While our focus here is on real space, our results make specific predictions for redshift space. For currently favored cosmological models, we find that the shifts for halos at z=0 increase by ∼0.3\%; at high z, they increase by ∼0.5\%D2. Our results demonstrate that these theoretical systematics are smaller than the statistical precision of upcoming surveys, even if one ignored the corrections discussed here. Simple modeling, along the lines discussed here, has the potential to reduce these systematics to below the levels of cosmic variance limited surveys.},

We apply the reconstruction technique to the clustering of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample, sharpening the BAO feature and achieving a 1.9 per cent measurement of the distance to z = 0.35. We update the reconstruction algorithm of Eisenstein et al. to account for the effects of survey geometry as well as redshift-space distortions and validate it on 160 LasDamas simulations. We demonstrate that reconstruction sharpens the BAO feature in the angle averaged galaxy correlation function, reducing the non-linear smoothing scale Σ\textsubscript{nl} from 8.1 to 4.4 Mpc h\textsuperscript{-1}. Reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift-space distortions at the BAO scale, isotropizing the correlation function. This sharpened BAO feature yields an unbiased distance estimate (\&lt;0.2 per cent) and reduces the scatter from 3.3 to 2.1 per cent. We demonstrate the robustness of these results to the various reconstruction parameters, including the smoothing scale, the galaxy bias and the linear growth rate. Applying this reconstruction algorithm to the SDSS LRG DR7 sample improves the significance of the BAO feature in these data from 3.3σ for the unreconstructed correlation function to 4.2σ after reconstruction. We estimate a relative distance scale D\textsubscript{V}/r\textsubscript{s} to z = 0.35 of 8.88 ± 0.17, where r\textsubscript{s} is the sound horizon and DV≡(DA2H-1)1/3 is a combination of the angular diameter distance D\textsubscript{A} and Hubble parameter H. Assuming a sound horizon of 154.25 Mpc, this translates into a distance measurement D\textsubscript{V}(z = 0.35) = 1.356 ± 0.025 Gpc. We find that reconstruction reduces the distance error in the DR7 sample from 3.5 to 1.9 per cent, equivalent to a survey with three times the volume of SDSS.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillations and elucidate how a mis-estimation of the cosmology, which leads to incorrect values of the angular diameter distance, d\_A, and Hubble parameter, H, manifest themselves in changes to the monopole and quadrupole power spectrum of biased tracers of the density field. Previous work has focused on the monopole power spectrum, and shown that the isotropic "dilation" combination d\_A\^2/H is robustly constrained by an overall shift in the scale of the baryon feature. We extend this by demonstrating that the quadrupole power spectrum is sensitive to an anisotropic "warping" mode d\_A H, allowing one to break the degeneracy between d\_A and H. We describe a method for measuring this warping, explicitly marginalizing over the form of redshift space distortions. We verify this method on N-body simulations and estimate that d\_A H can be measured with a fractional accuracy of \textasciitilde{} 3/sqrt(V) \% where the survey volume is estimated in (Gpc/h)\^3.},

We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to constrain the parameters of the best-fitting models, both for the H I-halo mass (HIHM) relation and the H I radial density profile. We find that a radial exponential profile results in a good fit to the low-redshift H I observations, including the clustering and the column density distribution. The form of the profile is also found to match the high-redshift DLA observations, when used in combination with a three-parameter HIHM relation and a redshift evolution in the H I concentration. The halo model predictions are in good agreement with the observed H I surface density profiles of low-redshift galaxies, and the general trends in the impact parameter and covering fraction observations of high-redshift DLAs. We provide convenient tables summarizing the best-fitting halo model predictions.},

The algorithm decouples the problem of "relative" calibrations from that of "absolute" calibrations; the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire survey. We pay special attention to the spatial structure of the calibration errors, allowing one to isolate particular error modes in downstream analyses. Applying this to the SDSS imaging data, we achieve \textasciitilde 1\% relative calibration errors across 8500 deg2 in griz; the errors are \textasciitilde 2\% for the u band. These errors are dominated by unmodeled atmospheric variations at Apache Point Observatory. These calibrations, dubbed "ubercalibration," are now public with SDSS Data Release 6 and will be a part of subsequent SDSS data releases.},

We reformulate this method within the Lagrangian picture of structure formation, to better understand what such a method does, and what the resulting power spectra are. We show that reconstruction does not reproduce the linear density field, at second order. We however show that it does reduce the damping of the oscillations due to nonlinear structure formation, explaining the improvements seen in simulations. Our results suggest that the reconstructed power spectrum is potentially better modeled as the sum of three different power spectra, each dominating over different wavelength ranges and with different nonlinear damping terms. Finally, we also show that reconstruction reduces the mode-coupling term in the power spectrum, explaining why miscalibrations of the acoustic scale are reduced when one considers the reconstructed power spectrum.},

  abstract = {The dependence of galaxy clustering on local density provides an effective method for extracting non-Gaussian information from galaxy surveys. The two-point correlation function (2PCF) provides a complete statistical description of a Gaussian density field. However, the late-time density field becomes non-Gaussian due to non-linear gravitational evolution and higher-order summary statistics are required to capture all of its cosmological information. Using a Fisher formalism based on halo catalogues from the Quijote simulations, we explore the possibility of retrieving this information using the density-split clustering (DS) method, which combines clustering statistics from regions of different environmental density. We show that DS provides more precise constraints on the parameters of the \$\textbackslash nu \textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model compared to the 2PCF, and we provide suggestions for where the extra information may come from. DS improves the constraints on the sum of neutrino masses by a factor of \$8\$ and by factors of 5, 3, 4, 6, and 6 for \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_b\$, \$h\$, \$n\_s\$, and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, respectively. We compare DS statistics when the local density environment is estimated from the real or redshift-space positions of haloes. The inclusion of DS autocorrelation functions, in addition to the cross-correlation functions between DS environments and haloes, recovers most of the information that is lost when using the redshift-space halo positions to estimate the environment. We discuss the possibility of constructing simulation-based methods to model DS clustering statistics in different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is challenging in the non-linear regime for two-point statistics e.g. the two-point correlation function (2PCF). We take a different perspective to split the galaxy density field according to the local density, and cross-correlate those densities with the entire galaxy field. Using mock galaxies, we demonstrate that combining a series of cross-correlation functions (CCFs) offers improvements over the 2PCF as follows: 1. The distribution of peculiar velocities in each split density is nearly Gaussian. This allows the Gaussian streaming model for RSD to perform accurately within the statistical errors of a (\$1.5\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\$Gpc)\$\^3\$ volume for almost all scales and all split densities. 2. The PDF of the density field at small scales is non-Gaussian, but the CCFs of split densities capture the non-Gaussianity, leading to improved cosmological constraints over the 2PCF. We can obtain unbiased constraints on the growth parameter \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{12\}\$ at the per-cent level, and Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameters at the sub-per-cent level with the minimal scale of \$15\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. This is a \$\textbackslash sim\$30 per cent and \$\textbackslash sim\$6 times improvement over the 2PCF, respectively. The diverse and steep slopes of the CCFs at small scales are likely to be responsible for the improved constraints of AP parameters. 3. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are contained in all CCFs of split densities. Including BAO scales helps to break the degeneracy between the line-of-sight and transverse AP parameters, allowing independent constraints on them. We discuss and compare models for RSD around spherical densities.},

Once trained, our classifiers are able to identify various contaminants, such as cosmic rays, hot and bad pixels, persistence effects, satellite or plane trails, residual fringe patterns, nebulous features, saturated pixels, diffraction spikes, and tracking errors in images. They encompass a broad range of ambient conditions, such as seeing, image sampling, detector type, optics, and stellar density. The first classifier, MAXIMASK, performs semantic segmentation and generates bad pixel maps for each contaminant, based on the probability that each pixel belongs to a given contaminant class. The second classifier, MAXITRACK, classifies entire images and mosaics, by computing the probability for the focal plane to be affected by tracking errors. We gathered training and testing data from real data originating from various modern charged-coupled devices and near-infrared cameras, that are augmented with image simulations. We quantified the performance of both classifiers and show that MAXIMASK achieves state-of-the-art performance for the identification of cosmic ray hits. Thanks to a built-in Bayesian update mechanism, both classifiers can be tuned to meet specific science goals in various observational contexts.},

(2013), complemented by additional cosmological probes. The interpretation of the measured Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ spectrum is done using a second-order Taylor expansion of the simulated power spectrum. BOSS Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ data alone provide better bounds than previous Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ results, but are still poorly constraining, especially for the sum of neutrino masses \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu\$, for which we obtain an upper bound of 1.1\textasciitilde eV (95\textbackslash\% CL), including systematics for both data and simulations. Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ constraints on \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM parameters and neutrino masses are compatible with CMB bounds from the Planck collaboration. Interestingly, the combination of Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ with CMB data reduces the uncertainties significantly, due to very different directions of degeneracy in parameter space, leading to the strongest cosmological bound to date on the total neutrino mass, \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu {$<$} 0.15\$\textasciitilde eV at 95\textbackslash\% CL (with a best-fit in zero). Adding recent BAO results further tightens this constraint to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu {$<$} 0.14\$\textasciitilde eV at 95\textbackslash\% CL. This bound is nearly independent of the statistical approach used, and of the different combinations of CMB and BAO data sets considered in this paper in addition to Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$. Given the measured values of the two squared mass differences \$\textbackslash Delta m\^2\$, this result tends to favor the normal hierarchy scenario against the inverted hierarchy scenario for the masses of the active neutrino species.},

  abstract = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan  Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV/eBOSS) has an extensive quasar program that combines several selection methods. Among these, the photometric variability technique provides highly uniform samples, which are unaffected by the redshift bias of traditional optical-color selections, when z = 2.7-3.5 quasars cross the stellar locus or when host galaxy light affects quasar colors at z{$<$} 0.9. We present the variability selection of quasars in eBOSS, focusing on a specific program that led to a sample of 13 876 quasars to gdered = 22.5 over a 94.5 deg2 region in Stripe 82, which has an areal density 1.5 times higher than over the rest of the eBOSS footprint. We use these variability-selected data to provide a new measurement of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) in the redshift range of 0.68 g(z = 2) = -21.80 at low redshift and to Mg(z = 2) = -26.20 at z \textasciitilde{} 4. We fit the QLF using two independent double-power-law models with ten free parameters each. The first model is a pure luminosity-function evolution (PLE) with bright-end and faint-end slopes allowed to be different on either side of z = 2.2. The other is a simple PLE at z{$<$} 2.2, combined with a model that comprises both luminosity and density evolution (LEDE) at z{$>$} 2.2. Both models are constrained to be continuous at z = 2.2. They present a flattening of the bright-end slope at high redshift. The LEDE model indicates a reduction of the break density with increasing redshift, but the evolution of the break magnitude depends on the parameterization. The models are in excellent accord, predicting quasar counts that agree within 0.3\% (resp., 1.1\%) to g{$<$} 22.5 (resp., g{$<$} 23). The models are also in good agreement over the entire redshift range with models from previous studies.},

Assuming a ΛCDM cosmology including massive neutrinos, we find that the latest SDSS DR14 BOSS and eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data is in very good agreement with current weak lensing constraints on (Ωm, σ8) and has the same small level of tension with Planck. We did not identify a systematic effect in the data analysis that could explain this small tension, but we show that it can be reduced in extended cosmological models where the spectral index is not the same on the very different times and scales probed by CMB and Lyman-$\alpha$ data. A particular case is that of a ΛCDM model including a running of the spectral index on top of massive neutrinos. With combined Lyman-$\alpha$ and Planck data, we find a slight (3σ) preference for negative running, $\alpha$s= −0.010 ± 0.004 (68\%CL). Neutrino mass bounds are found to be robust against different assumptions. In the ΛCDM model with running, we find ∑ mν 5.3 keV (95\%CL).},

The completeness of our sample was derived directly from a control sample of quasars, without requiring complex simulations of quasar light-curves or colors. A total of 1877 quasar spectra were obtained from dedicated programs on the Sloan telescope (as part of the SDSS-III/BOSS survey) and on the Multiple Mirror Telescope. They allowed us to derive the quasar luminosity function. It agrees well with results previously published in the redshift range 0.68 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.6.

  abstract = {We present constraints on neutrino masses, the primordial fluctuation spectrum from inflation, and other parameters of the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, using the one-dimensional Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$-forest power spectrum measured by Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013) from SDSS-III/BOSS, complemented by Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and other cosmological probes. This paper improves on the previous analysis by Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2015) by using a more powerful set of calibrating hydrodynamical simulations that reduces uncertainties associated with resolution and box size, by adopting a more flexible set of nuisance parameters for describing the evolution of the intergalactic medium, by including additional freedom to account for systematic uncertainties, and by using Planck 2015 constraints in place of Planck 2013. Fitting Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellent agreement with the values derived independently from CMB data, except for a weak tension on the scalar index \$n\_s\$. Combining BOSS Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ with Planck CMB constrains the sum of neutrino masses to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu {$<$} 0.12\$ eV (95\textbackslash\% C.L.) including all identified systematic uncertainties, tighter than our previous limit (0.15 eV) and more robust. Adding Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ data to CMB data reduces the uncertainties on the optical depth to reionization \$\textbackslash tau\$, through the correlation of \$\textbackslash tau\$ with \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. Similarly, correlations between cosmological parameters help in constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial fluctuations \$r\$. The tension on \$n\_s\$ can be accommodated by allowing for a running \$\{\textbackslash mathrm d\}n\_s/\{\textbackslash mathrm d\}\textbackslash ln k\$. Allowing running as a free parameter in the fits does not change the limit on \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu\$. We discuss possible interpretations of these results in the context of slow-roll inflation.},

  abstract = {We have developed two independent methods for measuring the one-dimensional power spectrum of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The first method is based on a Fourier transform and the second on a maximum-likelihood estimator. The two methods are independent and have different systematic uncertainties. Determination of the noise level in the data spectra was subject to a new treatment, because of its significant impact on the derived power spectrum. We applied the two methods to 13 821 quasar spectra from SDSS-III/BOSS DR9 selected from a larger sample of over 60 000 spectra on the basis of their high quality, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and good spectral resolution. The power spectra measured using either approach are in good agreement over all twelve redshift bins from ⟨z⟩ = 2.2 to ⟨z⟩ = 4.4, and scales from 0.001 km s-1 to 0.02 km s-1. We determined the methodological andinstrumental systematic uncertainties of our measurements. We provide a preliminary cosmological interpretation of our measurements using available hydrodynamical simulations. The improvement in precision over previously published results from SDSS is a factor 2-3 for constraints on relevant cosmological parameters. For a ΛCDM model and using a constraint on H0 that encompasses measurements based on the local distance ladder and on CMB anisotropies, we infer σ8 = 0.83 ± 0.03 and ns = 0.97 ± 0.02 based on H i absorption in the range 2.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.7.

  abstract = {The SDSS-III BOSS Quasar survey will attempt to observe z{$>$}2.15 quasars at a density of at least 15 per square degree to yield the first measurement of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the Ly-alpha forest. To help reaching this goal, we have developed a method to identify quasars based on their variability in the u g r i z optical bands. The method has been applied to the selection of quasar targets in the SDSS region known as Stripe 82 (the Southern equatorial stripe), where numerous photometric observations are available over a 10-year baseline. This area was observed by BOSS during September and October 2010. Only 8\% of the objects selected via variability are not quasars, while 90\% of the previously identified high-redshift quasar population is recovered. The method allows for a significant increase in the z{$>$}2.15 quasar density over previous strategies based on optical (ugriz) colors, achieving a density of 24.0 deg\^\{-2\} on average down to g\textasciitilde 22 over the 220 deg\^2 area of Stripe 82. We applied this method to simulated data from the Palomar Transient Factory and from Pan-STARRS, and showed that even with data that have sparser time sampling than what is available in Stripe 82, including variability in future quasar selection strategies would lead to increased target selection efficiency in the z{$>$}2.15 redshift range. We also found that Broad Absorption Line quasars are preferentially present in a variability than in a color selection.},

  abstract = {We use a sample of 97 galaxies selected from the Arecibo legacy fast  ALFA (ALFALFA) 21 cm survey to make an accurate measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). These galaxies are specifically selected to be heavily gas-dominated (Mgas/M∗ ≳ 2.7) and to be oriented edge-on. The former property ensures that the error on the galactic baryonic mass is small, despite the large systematic uncertainty involved in galactic stellar mass estimates. The latter property means that rotational velocities can be derived directly from the width of the 21 cm emission line, without any need for inclination corrections. We measure a slope for the linewidth-based BTFR of $\alpha$ = 3.75 ± 0.11, a value that is somewhat steeper than (but in broad agreement with) previous literature results. The relation is remarkably tight, with almost all galaxies being located within a perpendicular distance of ± 0.1 dex from the best fit line. The low observational error budget for our sample enables us to establish that, despite its tightness, the measured linewidth-based BTFR has some small (i.e., non-zero) intrinsic scatter. We furthermore find a systematic difference in the BTFR of galaxies with "double-horned" 21 cm line profiles - suggestive of flat outer galactic rotation curves - and those with "peaked" profiles - suggestive of rising rotation curves. When we restrict our sample of galaxies to objects in the former category, we measure a slightly steeper slope of $\alpha$ = 4.13 ± 0.15. Overall, the high-accuracy measurement of the BTFR presented in this article is intended as a reliable observational benchmark against which to test theoretical expectations. Here we consider a representative set of semi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations in the lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) context, as well as modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). In the near future, interferometric follow-up observations of several sample members will enable us to further refine the BTFR measurement, and make sharper comparisons with theoretical models.},

We describe the sample selection, basic properties of the galaxies and caveats for working with the data. We calculate the real- and redshift-space two-point correlation functions of these galaxies, fit these measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modelling within dark matter cosmological simulations, and estimate the errors using mock catalogues. These galaxies lie in massive haloes, with a mean halo mass of 5.2 × 1013 h-1 M⊙, a large-scale bias of ˜2.0 and a satellite fraction of 12 ± 2 per cent. Thus, these galaxies occupy haloes with average masses in between those of the higher redshift BOSS CMASS sample and the original SDSS I/II luminous red galaxy sample.},

  abstract = {From a principal component analysis (PCA) of 78 z \textasciitilde{} 3 high-quality quasar spectra in the SDSS-DR7 we derive the principal components that characterize the QSO continuum over the full available wavelength range. The shape of the mean continuum is similar to that measured at low-z (z \textasciitilde{} 1), but the equivalent width of the emission lines is larger at low redshift. We calculate the correlation between fluxes at different wavelengths and find that the emission line fluxes in the red part of the spectrum are correlated with those in the blue part. We construct a projection matrix to predict the continuum in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest from the red part of the spectrum. We apply this matrix to quasars in the SDSS-DR7 to derive the evolution with redshift of the mean flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest caused by the absorption by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen. A change in the evolution of the mean flux is apparent around z \textasciitilde{} 3 as a steeper decrease of the mean flux at higher redshifts. The same evolution is found when the continuum is estimated from the extrapolation of a power-law continuum fitted in the red part of the quasar spectrum if a correction derived from simple simulations is applied. Our findings are consistent with previous determinations using high spectral resolution data. We provide the PCA eigenvectors over the wavelength range 1020-2000 Å and the distribution of their weights that can be used to simulate QSO mock spectra. {$<$}P /{$>$}Eigenvectors and projection matrix are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/530/A50"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/530/A50{$<$}/A{$>$}},

The number of quasars with z \&gt; 2.15 (184 101, of which 167 742 are new discoveries) is about an order of magnitude greater than the number of z \&gt; 2.15 quasars known prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest emission lines (C iv, C III], Mg II). The catalog identifies 29 580 broad absorption line quasars and lists their characteristics. For each object, the catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, I, z) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag together with some information on the optical morphology and the selection criteria. When available, the catalog also provides information on the optical variability of quasars using SDSS and Palomar Transient Factory multi-epoch photometry.

  abstract = {Density inhomogeneity in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can boost the  recombination rate of ionized gas substantially, affecting the growth of H ii regions during reionization. Previous attempts to quantify this effect typically failed to resolve down to the Jeans scale in the preionization IGM, which is important in establishing this effect, along with the hydrodynamical back-reaction of reionization on it. Toward that end, we perform a set of fully coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations from cosmological initial conditions, extending the mass resolution of previous work to the scale of minihalos. Pre-reionization structure is evolved until a redshift z i at which the ionizing radiation from external sources arrives to sweep an R-type ionization front supersonically across the volume in a few million years, until it is trapped on the surfaces of minihalos and converted to D-type, after which the minihalo gas is removed by photoevaporative winds. Small-scale density structures during this time lead to a high ({$>$}10) clumping factor for ionized gas, which hugely boosts the recombination rate until the structures are disrupted by the hydrodynamic feedback after ˜10-100 Myr. For incoming stellar radiation with intensity J 21 in a 200 h -1 kpc box with the mean density contrast \textbackslash bar\{δ \}, the number of extra recombinations per H atom, on top of what is expected from homogeneously distributed gas, is given by 0.32\{[\{J\}21]\}0.12\{[(1+\{z\}i)/11]\}-1.7\{[1+\textbackslash bar\{δ \}]\}2.5. In models in which most of the volume is ionized toward the end of reionization, this can add more than one recombination per H atom to the ionizing photon budget to achieve reionization.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We perform full analyses of different cosmological models using the WiggleZ power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and 0.78, combined with other cosmological data sets. The limiting factor in this analysis is the theoretical modeling of the galaxy power spectrum, including nonlinearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. In this paper we assess several different methods for modeling the theoretical power spectrum, testing them against the Gigaparsec WiggleZ simulations (GiggleZ). We fit for a base set of six cosmological parameters, \{Ω\vphantom\}\textsubscript{b}h\textsuperscript{2},Ω\textsubscript{CDM}h\textsuperscript{2},H\textsubscript{0},τ,A\textsubscript{s},n\textsubscript{s}\vphantom\{\}, and five supplementary parameters \{n\vphantom\}\textsubscript{run},r,w,Ω\textsubscript{k},∑m\textsubscript{ν}\vphantom\{\}.

Using WiggleZ data with cosmic microwave background and other distance and matter power spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parameters being inconsistent with their ΛCDM model values. The power spectra data and theoretical modeling tools are available for use as a module for CosmoMC, which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data.

  abstract = {We have applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify and  detect quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 and also to predict the photometric redshifts of quasars. The network takes the variability of objects into account by converting light curves into images. The width of the images, noted w, corresponds to the five magnitudes ugriz and the height of the images, noted h, represents the date of the observation. The CNN provides good results since its precision is 0.988 for a recall of 0.90, compared to a precision of 0.985 for the same recall with a random forest classifier. Moreover 175 new quasar candidates are found with the CNN considering a fixed recall of 0.97. The combination of probabilities given by the CNN and the random forest makes good performance even better with a precision of 0.99 for a recall of 0.90. For the redshift predictions, the CNN presents excellent results which are higher than those obtained with a feature extraction step and different classifiers (a K-nearest-neighbors, a support vector machine, a random forest and a Gaussian process classifier). Indeed, the accuracy of the CNN within |Δz| {$<$} 0.1 can reach 78.09\%, within |Δz| {$<$} 0.2 reaches 86.15\%, within |Δz| {$<$} 0.3 reaches 91.2\% and the value of root mean square (rms) is 0.359. The performance of the KNN decreases for the three |Δz| regions, since within the accuracy of |Δz| {$<$} 0.1, |Δz| {$<$} 0.2, and |Δz| {$<$} 0.3 is 73.72\%, 82.46\%, and 90.09\% respectively, and the value of rms amounts to 0.395. So the CNN successfully reduces the dispersion and the catastrophic redshifts of quasars. This new method is very promising for the future of big databases such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

  abstract = {We developed a deeP architecturE for the LIght Curve ANalysis (PELICAN) for the characterization and the classification of supernovae light curves. It takes light curves as input, without any additional features. PELICAN can deal with the sparsity and the irregular sampling of light curves. It is designed to remove the problem of non-representativeness between the training and test databases coming from the limitations of the spectroscopic follow-up. We applied our methodology on different supernovae light curve databases. First, we tested PELICAN on the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge for which we obtained the best performance ever achieved with a non-representative training database, by reaching an accuracy of 0.811. Then we tested PELICAN on simulated light curves of the LSST Deep Fields for which PELICAN is able to detect 87.4\% of supernovae Ia with a precision higher than 98\%, by considering a non-representative training database of 2k light curves. PELICAN can be trained on light curves of LSST Deep Fields to classify light curves of the LSST main survey, which have a lower sampling rate and are more noisy. In this scenario, it reaches an accuracy of 96.5\% with a training database of 2k light curves of the Deep Fields. This constitutes a pivotal result as type Ia supernovae candidates from the main survey might then be used to increase the statistics without additional spectroscopic follow-up. Finally we tested PELICAN on real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. PELICAN reaches an accuracy of 86.8\% with a training database composed of simulated data and a fraction of 10\% of real data. The ability of PELICAN to deal with the different causes of non-representativeness between the training and test databases, and its robustness against survey properties and observational conditions, put it in the forefront of light curve classification tools for the LSST era.},

Our method exploits all the information present in the images without any feature extraction. The input data consist of 64 × 64 pixel ugriz images centered on the spectroscopic targets, plus the galactic reddening value on the line-of-sight. For training sets of 100k objects or more (≥20\% of the database), we reach a dispersion σMAD {$<$} 0.01, significantly lower than the current best one obtained from another machine learning technique on the same sample. The bias is lower than 10-4, independent of photometric redshift. The PDFs are shown to have very good predictive power. We also find that the CNN redshifts are unbiased with respect to galaxy inclination, and that σMAD decreases with the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), achieving values below 0.007 for S/N {$>$} 100, as in the deep stacked region of Stripe 82. We argue that for most galaxies the precision is limited by the S/N of SDSS images rather than by the method.

  abstract = {Galaxy surveys probe both structure formation and the expansion rate, making them promising avenues for understanding the dark universe. Photometric surveys accurately map the 2D distribution of galaxy positions and shapes in a given redshift range, while spectroscopic surveys provide sparser 3D maps of the galaxy distribution. We present a way to analyse overlapping 2D and 3D maps jointly and without loss of information. We represent 3D maps using spherical Fourier-Bessel (sFB) modes, which preserve radial coverage while accounting for the spherical sky geometry, and we decompose 2D maps in a spherical harmonic basis. In these bases, a simple expression exists for the cross-correlation of the two fields. One very powerful application is the ability to simultaneously constrain the redshift distribution of the photometric sample, the sample biases, and cosmological parameters. We use our framework to show that combined analysis of DESI and LSST can improve cosmological constraints by factors of \$\{\textbackslash sim\}1.2\$ to \$\{\textbackslash sim\}1.8\$ on the region where they overlap relative to identically sized disjoint regions. We also show that in the overlap of DES and SDSS-III in Stripe 82, cross-correlating improves photo-\$z\$ parameter constraints by factors of \$\{\textbackslash sim\}2\$ to \$\{\textbackslash sim\}12\$ over internal photo-\$z\$ reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Galaxy redshift surveys are subject to incompleteness and inhomogeneous sampling due to the various constraints inherent to spectroscopic observations. This can introduce systematic errors on the summary statistics of interest, which need to be mitigated in cosmological analysis to achieve high accuracy. Standard practices involve applying weighting schemes based on completeness estimates across the survey footprint, possibly supplemented with additional weighting schemes accounting for density-dependent effects. In this work, we concentrate on pure angular systematics and describe an alternative approach consisting in analysing the galaxy two-point correlation function where angular modes are nulled. By construction, this procedure removes all possible known and unknown sources of angular observational systematics, but also part of the cosmological signal. We use a modified Landy-Szalay estimator for the two-point correlation function that relies on an additional random catalogue where angular positions are randomly drawn from the galaxy catalogue, and provide an analytical model to describe this modified statistic. We test the model by performing an analysis of the full anisotropic clustering in mock catalogues of luminous red and emission-line galaxies at 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.1. We find that the model fully accounts for the modified correlation function in redshift space, without introducing new nuisance parameters. The derived cosmological parameters from the analysis of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions display slightly larger statistical uncertainties, mostly for the growth rate of structure parameter fσ8 that exhibits a \$50\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ statistical error increase, but free from angular systematic error.},

  abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat Ω=0.3 model (ΛCDM), but not for an Ω=1 model with the same power spectrum (τCDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high Ω, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the ΛCDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

  abstract = {The covariance matrices of power-spectrum (P(k)) measurements from galaxy surveys are difficult to compute theoretically. The current best practice is to estimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number of mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require thousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired accuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with the number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a method of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified, few-parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS DR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit the covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed with this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks and only ̃100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse covariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method should work equally well for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher accuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.},

  abstract = {Using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations with cold dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos, we present a detailed study of the effect of massive neutrinos on the 1-D and 3-D flux power spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest. The presence of massive neutrinos in cosmology induces a scale- and time-dependent suppression of structure formation that is strongest on small scales. Measuring this suppression is a key method for inferring neutrino masses from cosmological data, and is one of the main goals of ongoing and future surveys like eBOSS, DES, LSST, Euclid or DESI . The clustering in the Ly$\alpha$ forest traces the quasi-linear power at late times and on small scales. In combination with observations of the cosmic microwave background, the forest therefore provides some of the tightest constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses. However there is a well-known degeneracy between Σmν and the amplitude of perturbations in the linear matter power spectrum. We study the corresponding degeneracy in the 1-D flux power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, and for the first time also study this degeneracy in the 3-D flux power spectrum. We show that the non-linear effects of massive neutrinos on the Ly$\alpha$ forest, beyond the effect of linear power amplitude suppression, are negligible, and this degeneracy persists in the Ly$\alpha$ forest observables to a high precision. We discuss the implications of this degeneracy for choosing parametrisations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest for cosmological analysis.},

  abstract = {We describe Ly$\alpha$ Mass Association Scheme (LyMAS), a method of  predicting clustering statistics in the Ly$\alpha$ forest on large scales from moderate-resolution simulations of the dark matter (DM) distribution, with calibration from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of smaller volumes. We use the "Horizon-MareNostrum" simulation, a 50 h -1 Mpc comoving volume evolved with the adaptive mesh hydrodynamic code RAMSES, to compute the conditional probability distribution P(Fs |δ s ) of the transmitted flux Fs , smoothed (one-dimensionally, 1D) over the spectral resolution scale, on the DM density contrast δ s , smoothed (three-dimensionally, 3D) over a similar scale. In this study we adopt the spectral resolution of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) at z = 2.5, and we find optimal results for a DM smoothing length σ = 0.3 h -1 Mpc (comoving). In its simplest form, LyMAS draws randomly from the hydro-calibrated P(Fs |δ s ) to convert DM skewers into Ly$\alpha$ forest pseudo-spectra, which are then used to compute cross-sightline flux statistics. In extended form, LyMAS exactly reproduces both the 1D power spectrum and one-point flux distribution of the hydro simulation spectra. Applied to the MareNostrum DM field, LyMAS accurately predicts the two-point conditional flux distribution and flux correlation function of the full hydro simulation for transverse sightline separations as small as 1 h -1 Mpc, including redshift-space distortion effects. It is substantially more accurate than a deterministic density-flux mapping ("Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation"), often used for large-volume simulations of the forest. With the MareNostrum calibration, we apply LyMAS to 10243 N-body simulations of a 300 h -1 Mpc and 1.0 h -1 Gpc cube to produce large, publicly available catalogs of mock BOSS spectra that probe a large comoving volume. LyMAS will be a powerful tool for interpreting 3D Ly$\alpha$ forest data, thereby transforming measurements from BOSS and other massive quasar absorption surveys into constraints on dark energy, DM, space geometry, and intergalactic medium physics.},

Our emulator is based on a 2nd-order Lagrangian bias expansion that is displaced to Eulerian space using cosmological \$N\$-body simulations.

We build the emulator using a forward neural network trained with the simulations of the BACCO project, which covers an 8-dimensional parameter space including massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. We show that our emulator provides unbiased cosmological constraints from the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole of a mock galaxy catalogue that mimics the BOSS-CMASS sample down to nonlinear scales (\$k\textbackslash sim0.6\$[\$h/\$Mpc]\$\^\{3\}\$).

  abstract = {We study the impact of neutrino masses on the shape and height of the BAO peak of the matter correlation function, both in real and redshift space. In order to describe the nonlinear evolution of the BAO peak we run N-body simulations and compare them with simple analytic formulae. We show that the evolution with redshift of the correlation function and its dependence on the neutrino masses is well reproduced in a simplified version of the Zel'dovich approximation, in which the mode-coupling contribution to the power spectrum is neglected. While in linear theory the BAO peak decreases for increasing neutrino masses, the effect of nonlinear structure formation goes in the opposite direction, since the peak broadening by large scale flows is less effective. As a result of this combined effect, the peak decreases by \textasciitilde{} 0.6 \% for ∑ m\textsubscript{ν} = 0.15 eV and increases by \textasciitilde 1.2\% for ∑ m\textsubscript{ν} = 0.3 eV, with respect to a massless neutrino cosmology with equal value of the other cosmological parameters. We extend our analysis to redshift space and to halos, and confirm the agreement between simulations and the analytic formulae. We argue that all analytical approaches having the Zel'dovich propagator in their lowest order approximation should give comparable performances, irrespectively to their formulation in Lagrangian or in Eulerian space. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We analyse the clustering of galaxies within this sample, including both the luminous red galaxy and main samples, and also include the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey data. In total, this sample comprises 893319 galaxies over 9100deg2. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are observed in power spectra measured for different slices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at multiple epochs. We achieve a distance measure at redshift z = 0.275, of rs(zd)/DV(0.275) = 0.1390 +/- 0.0037 (2.7 per cent accuracy), where rs(zd) is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, DV(z) ≡ [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3, DA(z) is the angular diameter distance and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. We find an almost independent constraint on the ratio of distances DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.736 +/- 0.065, which is consistent at the 1.1σ level with the best-fitting Λ cold dark matter model obtained when combining our z = 0.275 distance constraint with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year (WMAP5) data. The offset is similar to that found in previous analyses of the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is now of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and a change in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using WMAP5 constraints on Ωbh2 and Ωch2, and combining our BAO distance measurements with those from the Union supernova sample, places a tight constraint on Ωm = 0.286 +/- 0.018 and H0 = 68.2 +/- 2.2kms-1Mpc-1 that is robust to allowing Ωk ≠ 0 and w ≠ -1. This result is independent of the behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the BAO and supernova measurements. Combining these data sets with the full WMAP5 likelihood constraints provides tight constraints on both Ωk = -0.006 +/- 0.008 and w = -0.97 +/- 0.10 for a constant dark energy equation of state.},

The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important, due to the precision that BOSS can now reach: even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of two-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ̃20 per cent, depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured. In this paper, we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitting parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix. Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply the formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers. To further aid these analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for two-point measurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for BAO, and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function for anisotropic-BAO and RSD measurements.},

  abstract = {We extend the Fourier transform based method for the analysis of galaxy redshift surveys of Feldman, Kaiser \& Peacock (FKP) to model luminosity-dependent clustering. In a magnitude-limited survey, galaxies at high redshift are more luminous on average than galaxies at low redshift. Galaxy clustering is observed to increase with luminosity, so the inferred density field is effectively multiplied by an increasing function of radius. This has the potential to distort the shape of the recovered power spectrum. In this paper, we present an extension of the FKP analysis method to incorporate this effect, and present revised optimal weights to maximize the precision of such an analysis. The method is tested and its accuracy is assessed using mock catalogues of the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). We also show that the systematic effect caused by ignoring luminosity-dependent bias was negligible for the initial analysis of the 2dFGRS of Percival et al. However, future surveys, sensitive to larger scales, or covering a wider range of galaxy luminosities, will benefit from this refined method.},

  abstract = {The real-space power spectrum of L* galaxies measured from  the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is presented. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was used to fit radial and angular modes resulting from a spherical harmonics decomposition of the 2dFGRS overdensity field (described in a previous paper) with 16 real-space power spectrum values and linear redshift-space distortion parameter β(L*, 0). The recovered marginalized band powers are compared to previous estimates of galaxy power spectra. Additionally, we provide a simple model for the 17-dimensional likelihood hypersurface in order to allow the likelihood to be quickly estimated given a set of model band powers and β(L*, 0). The likelihood surface is not well approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution with model-independent covariances. Instead, a model is presented in which the distribution of each band power has a Gaussian distribution in a combination of the band power and its logarithm. The relative contribution of each component was determined by fitting the MCMC output. Using these distributions, we demonstrate how the likelihood of a given cosmological model can be quickly and accurately estimated, and we use a simple set of models to compare estimated likelihoods with likelihoods calculated using the full spherical harmonics procedure. All of the data are made publicly available (from http://www.roe.ac.uk/\textasciitilde wjp/), enabling the spherical harmonics decomposition of the 2dFGRS of Percival et al. to be easily used as a cosmological constraint.},

  abstract = {We introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using  Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). BAOs are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.2. BAOs in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.35. The observed scales of the BAOs calculated from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure DV(z) ≡ [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3. Here DA is the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives rs/DV(0.2) = 0.1980 +/- 0.0058 and rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1094 +/- 0.0033 (1σ errors), with a correlation coefficient of 0.39, where rs is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the BAOs to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.812 +/- 0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) supernova data for Λ cold dark matter cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at a low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant w, then we find Ωm = 0.249 +/- 0.018 and w = -1.004 +/- 0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmological structure. In this paper, we develop and test a new statistic based on anisotropies in the measured galaxy power spectrum, which is independent of galaxy bias and matches the matter power spectrum shape on large scales. The amplitude provides a constraint on the derivative of the linear growth rate through fσ8(mass). This demonstrates that spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer many of the same advantages as weak lensing surveys, in that they both use galaxies as test particles to probe all matter in the Universe. They are complementary as redshift-space distortions probe non-relativistic velocities and therefore the temporal metric perturbations, while weak lensing tests the sum of the temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The degree to which our estimator can be pushed into the non-linear regime is considered and we show that a simple Gaussian damping model, similar to that previously used to model the behaviour of the power spectrum on very small scales, can also model the quasi-linear behaviour of our estimator. This enhances the information that can be extracted from surveys for Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) models.},

However, obtaining spectra of galaxies is expensive, and surveys often only measure redshifts for a subsample of a target galaxy population. Provided that the spectroscopic data is representative, we argue that angular pair upweighting should be used in these situations to improve the 3D clustering measurements. We present a toy model showing mathematically how such a weighting can improve measurements, and provide a practical example of its application using mocks created for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our analysis of mocks suggests that, if an angular clustering measurement is available over twice the area covered spectroscopically, weighting gives a \$\textbackslash sim\$10-20\% reduction of the variance of the monopole correlation function on the BAO scale.},

Our cross-correlation is well fitted by linear theory with the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda CDM\$ model, with a DLA bias of \$b\_\{\textbackslash rm DLA\} = 1.99\textbackslash pm 0.11\$; a more conservative analysis, which removes DLA in the Ly\$\textbackslash beta\$ forest and uses only the cross-correlation at \$r{$>$} 10\{\textbackslash rm h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,Mpc\}\$, yields \$b\_\{\textbackslash rm DLA\} = 2.00\textbackslash pm 0.19\$. This assumes the cosmological model from \textbackslash cite\{Planck2015\} and the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest bias factors of Bautista et al. 2017, and includes only statistical errors obtained from bootstrap analysis. The main systematic errors arise from possible impurities and selection effects in the DLA catalogue, and from uncertainties in the determination of the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest bias factors and a correction for effects of high column density absorbers. We find no dependence of the DLA bias on column density or redshift. The measured bias value corresponds to a host halo mass \$\textbackslash sim 4\textbackslash cdot10\^\{11\} \{\textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\}\$ if all DLA were hosted in halos of a similar mass.

We find that SQUEZE levels of performance (quantified with purity and completeness) are stable to spectra that have a noise dispersion four times that of our standard test sample, Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We also find that the performance remains unchanged if pixels of width 25 Å are considered, and decreases by  \$\textbackslash sim 2\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$  for pixels of width 100 Å. We see no effect when analysing subsets of different quasar brightness, and we establish that the blue part (up to 7000 Å) of the spectra is sufficient for the classification. Finally, we compare our suite of tests with samples of spectra expected from WEAVE-QSO and DESI, and narrow-band imaging from J-PAS. We conclude that SQUEZE will perform similarly when confronted with the demands of these future surveys as when applied to current BOSS data.},

The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8Omega\_M-0.6Omega\_Lambda\textasciitilde -0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest (Omega\_M{$<\sptilde$}1.5). For a flat (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1) cosmology we find Omega\^flat\_M=0.28\^+0.09\_-0.08 (1 sigma statistical) \^+0.05\_-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda{$>$}0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t\^flat\_0=14.9\^+1.4\_-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calán/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

Here, we study the two dominant 'motions' contributing to nearby peculiar redshifts: large-scale, coherent-flow (CF) motions and small-scale motions due to gravitationally-associated galaxies deemed to be in a galaxy group. We use a set of 585 low-\$z\$ SNe from the Pantheon+ sample, and evaluate the efficacy of corrections to these motions by measuring the improvement of SN distance residuals. We study multiple methods for modeling the large and small-scale motions and show that while group assignments and CF corrections individually contribute to small improvements in Hubble residual scatter, the greatest improvement comes from the combination of the two (relative standard deviation of the Hubble residuals RSD improves from 0.167 mag to 0.157 mag). We find the optimal flow corrections derived from various local density maps significantly reduce Hubble residuals while raising \$H\_0\$ by \$\textbackslash sim0.4\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ as compared to using CMB redshifts, disfavoring the hypothesis that unrecognized local structure could resolve the Hubble tension. We estimate that the systematic uncertainties in cosmological parameters after optimally correcting redshifts are 0.08-0.17 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ in \$H\_0\$ and 0.02-0.03 in \$w\$ which are smaller than the statistical uncertainties for these measurements: 1.5 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ for \$H\_0\$ and 0.04 for \$w\$.},

Our survey has been combined with published data at similar resolution and the resulting sample comprises 35 systems, 23 of which are splitted in a total of 87 subcomponents. The mean redshift of the sample is = 2.65. The distribution of velocity separations is best fitted by two Gaussian components with dispersions of 109 and 525 km s\^-1\^ and is very similar to the distribution observed in Mg II systems at redshift z\textasciitilde 1. The clustering on the smaller scale could be due to relative motions of clouds within galaxy haloes. The small observed value of the onedimensional velocity dispersion suggests that most of the systems are associated with potential wells characteristic of dwarf galaxies. The larger scale could reflect clustering of haloes in small groups. There are groups of redshifts spanning up to 1200 km s\^-1\^; our sample however is not large enough to investigate the clustering up to such velocity differences. As observed for Mg II systems there is a strong correlation between the total C IV equivalent width of the systems and the number of components. The correlation between the total equivalent width and the total velocity spread, \{DELTA\}V\_max\_, is strong for \{DELTA\}Vmax {$<$} 400 km s\^-1\^. For larger velocity spread the equivalent width tends to be smaller than what would be expected from extrapolation of the correlation at smaller velocity differences. Several examples of such highly multiple systems with comparatively small equivalent width have been observed at z \textasciitilde{} 1.5. Although they have not been searched for systematically they may be related to a different class of C IV systems and reveal a particular epoch in galaxy formation. The distribution of C IV column densities for the observed subcomponents is fitted by a power law dn/dN (CIV) is proportional to N\^- β\^ with β = 1.64 +/-0.10 in the range 13.4 {$<$} log N(C IV) {$<$} 14.8. We have investigated the possible relation between metal line systems and dark matter haloes in the framework of CDM models. The number of C IV systems per unit redshift is well reproduced for 0.3 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.5 if the properties of the associated galaxy gaseous haloes do not change much over this redshift range. At higher redshift C IV systems could be associated with the virialized part of haloes with circular velocity V\_c\_ {$>$} 70 km s\^-1\^. The large number of Lyman limit systems (LLS) observed at redshift larger than 3 suggests that part of the Ly$\alpha$ forest becomes optically thick at large redshift.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the growth rate of cosmological structure from the modelling of the anisotropic galaxy clustering measured in the final data release of the VIPERS survey. The analysis is carried out in configuration space and based on measurements of the first two even multipole moments of the anisotropic galaxy auto-correlation function, in two redshift bins spanning the range 0.5 \&lt;z\&lt; 1.2. We provide robust and cosmology-independent corrections for the VIPERS angular selection function, allowing recovery of the underlying clustering amplitude at the percent level down to the Mpc scale. We discuss several improvements on the non-linear modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) and perform detailed tests of a variety of approaches against a set of realistic VIPERS-like mock realisations. This includes using novel fitting functions to describe the velocity divergence and density power spectra P\textsubscript{θθ} and P\textsubscript{δθ} that appear in RSD models. These tests show that we are able to measure the growth rate with negligible bias down to separations of 5 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. Interestingly, the application to real data shows a weaker sensitivity to the details of non-linear RSD corrections compared to mock results. We obtain consistent values for the growth rate times the matter power spectrum normalisation parameter of fσ\textsubscript{8} = 0.55 ± 0.12 and 0.40 ± 0.11 at effective redshifts of z = 0.6 and z = 0.86 respectively. These results are in agreement with standard cosmology predictions assuming Einstein gravity in a ΛCDM background. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Cerro Paranal, Chile, using the Very Large Telescope under programs 182.A-0886 and partly 070.A-9007.

These are derived in the Gaussian limit (setting higher order correlation functions to zero), but for arbitrary non-linear 2PCFs (which may be estimated from the survey itself), with a shot-noise rescaling parameter included to capture non-Gaussianity. We generalize previous approaches to include Legendre moments via a geometry-correction function calibrated from measured pair and triple counts. Making use of importance sampling and random particle catalogues, we can estimate model covariances in fractions of the time required to do so with mocks, obtaining estimates with negligible sampling noise in ∼10 (∼100) CPU-hours for the 2PCF (3PCF) autocovariance. We compare results to sample covariances from a suite of BOSS DR12 mocks and find the matrices to be in good agreement, assuming a shot-noise rescaling parameter of 1.03 (1.20) for the 2PCF (3PCF). To obtain strongest constraints on cosmological parameters, we must use multiple statistics in concert; having robust methods to measure their covariances at low computational cost is thus of great relevance to upcoming surveys.},

  abstract = {Conventional estimators of the anisotropic power spectrum and two-point correlation function (2PCF) adopt the `Yamamoto approximation', fixing the line-of-sight of a pair of galaxies to that of just one of its members. Whilst this is accurate only to first-order in the characteristic opening angle \$\textbackslash theta\_\textbackslash max\$, it allows for efficient implementation via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). This work presents practical algorithms for computing the power spectrum and 2PCF multipoles using pairwise lines-of-sight, adopting either the galaxy midpoint or angle bisector definitions. Using newly derived infinite series expansions for spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials, we construct estimators accurate to arbitrary order in \$\textbackslash theta\_\textbackslash max\$, though note that the midpoint and bisector formalisms themselves differ at fourth order. Each estimator can be straightforwardly implemented using FFTs, requiring only modest additional computational cost relative to the Yamamoto approximation. We demonstrate the algorithms by applying them to a set of realistic mock galaxy catalogs, and find both procedures produce comparable results for the 2PCF, with a slight preference for the bisector power spectrum algorithm, albeit at the cost of greater memory usage. Such estimators provide a useful method to reduce wide-angle systematics for future surveys.},

Absorbers are selected as local minima in the spectra with 2.4 {$<$} τLy$\alpha$ {$<$} 4.0; at SDSS resolution (≈150 km s-1 FWHM), these absorbers are blends of systems that are individually weaker. In the stacked spectra, we detect seven Lyman series lines and metal lines of O VI, N V, C IV, C III, Si IV, C II, Al II, Si II, Fe II, Mg II, and O I. Many of these lines have peak optical depths of {$<$}0.02, but they are nonetheless detected at high statistical significance. Modeling the Lyman series measurements implies that our selected systems have total H I column densities N\_\{H I\} ≈ 10\^\{15.4\} cm\^\{-2\}. Assuming typical physical conditions ρ /\textbackslash bar\{ρ\}=10, T = 104-104.5 K, and [Fe/H]=-2 yields reasonable agreement with the line strengths of high-ionization species, but it underpredicts the low-ionization species by two orders of magnitude or more. This discrepancy suggests that the low-ionization lines arise in dense, cool, metal-rich clumps, present in some absorption systems.},

While the Ly$\alpha$ forest is a more sensitive tracer of intergalactic gas, it is limited by the fact that it can only be measured in the optical window at redshifts z \&gt; 2. Quasars are challenging to identify and observe at these high redshifts, but the C IV forest can be probed down to redshifts z ≈ 1.3, taking full advantage of the peak in the redshift distribution of quasars that can be targeted with high efficiency. I explore the strength of the C IV absorption signal and show that the absorbing population on the red side of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line is dominated by C IV (and so will dominate over the potential BAO signal of other metals). As a consequence, I argue that forthcoming surveys may have a sufficient increase in quasar number density to offset the lower sensitivity of the C IV forest and provide competitive precision using both the C IV autocorrelation and the C IV-quasar cross-correlation at \&lt;z\&gt; ≈ 1.6.},

We select forest absorbers by their flux in bins 138 km s-1 wide (approximately the size of the BOSS resolution element). We split these absorbers into five samples spanning the range of flux -0.05 ≤ F {$<$} 0.45. Tests on a smaller set of high-resolution spectra show that our three strongest absorption samples would probe circumgalactic regions (projected separation {$<$}300 proper kpc and |Δv| {$<$} 300 km s-1) in about 60 per cent of cases for very high signal-to-noise ratio. Within this subset, weakening Ly$\alpha$ absorption is associated with decreasing purity of circumgalactic selection once BOSS noise is included. Our weaker two Ly$\alpha$ absorption samples are dominated by the intergalactic medium. We present composite spectra of these samples and a catalogue of measured absorption features from H I and 13 metal ionization species, all of which we make available to the community. We compare measurements of seven Lyman series transitions in our composite spectra to single line models and obtain further constraints from their associated excess Lyman limit opacity. This analysis provides results consistent with column densities over the range 14.4 ≲ log (N\_\{H I\}) ≲ 16.45. We compare our measurements of metal absorption to a variety of simple single-line, single-phase models for a preliminary interpretation. Our results imply clumping on scales down to ˜30 pc and near-solar metallicities in the circumgalactic samples, while high-ionization metal absorption consistent with typical IGM densities and metallicities is visible in all samples.},

We use pixel correlation techniques to search for weak C IV and O VI absorption in the spectrum of quasar Q1422+231 in regions of the spectrum close to and far from galaxies at z\textasciitilde 3. This is achieved both by using the positions of observed Lyman-break galaxies and by using strong C IV absorption as a proxy for the presence of galaxies near the line of sight. We find that the metal line absorption is a strong function of not only the H I optical depth, and thus gas density, but also proximity to highly enriched regions, and so proximity to galaxies. The parameter ``proximity to galaxies'' can account for some, but not all, of the scatter in the strength of C IV absorption for fixed H I. Finally, we find that even if we limit our analysis to the two-thirds of the pixels that are at least 600 km s-1 from any C IV line that is strong enough to detect unambiguously (τCIV{$>$}0.1), our statistical analysis reveals only slightly less C IV for fixed H I than when we analyze the whole spectrum. We conclude that while the metallicity is enhanced in regions close to (Lyman-break) galaxies, the enrichment is likely to be much more widespread than their immediate surroundings.},

This survey is part of a broader WEAVE survey to be conducted at the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. We will focus on chiefly on the science goals, but will also briefly summarise the target selection methods anticipated and the expected survey plan. Understanding the apparent acceleration in the expansion of the Universe is one of the key scientific challenges of our time. Many experiments have been proposed to study this expansion, using a variety of techniques. Here we describe a survey that can measure this acceleration and therefore help elucidate the nature of dark energy: a survey of the Lyman-alpha forest (and quasar absorption in general) in spectra towards z{$>$}2 quasars (QSOs). Further constraints on neutrino masses and warm dark matter are also anticipated. The same data will also shed light on galaxy formation via study of the properties of inflowing/outflowing gas associated with nearby galaxies and in a cosmic web context. Gas properties are sensitive to density, temperature, UV radiation, metallicity and abundance pattern, and so constraint galaxy formation in a variety of ways. WEAVE-QSO will study absorbers with a dynamic range spanning more than 8 orders of magnitude in column density, their thermal broadening, and a host of elements and ionization species. A core principal of the WEAVE-QSO survey is the targeting of QSOs with near 100\% efficiency principally through use of the J-PAS (r {$<$} 23.2) and Gaia (r {$<$} 20) data.},

We point out a new \$\textbackslash simeq1.8\textbackslash sigma\$-tension on the baryonic density, or equivalently on the D/H abundance, between the value inferred on one hand from the analysis of the primordial abundances of light elements and, on the other hand, from the combination of CMB and baryonic oscillation data.

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter ΛCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25σ. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations (σ8) derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (ℓ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ\textsubscript{∗} = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10\textsuperscript{-2}, Ω\textsubscript{b}h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ω\textsubscript{c}h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and n\textsubscript{s} = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H\textsubscript{0} = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ω\textsubscript{m} = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H\textsubscript{0} and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r\textsubscript{0.002}\&lt; 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\textsubscript{eff} = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\textsubscript{eff} = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13\textsubscript{-0.10}\textsuperscript{+0.13}. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ΛCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ ℓ ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

  abstract = {We present the most significant measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential to date (at a level of 40σ), using temperature and polarization data from the Planck 2015 full-mission release. Using a polarization-only estimator, we detect lensing at a significance of 5σ. We cross-check the accuracy of our measurement using the wide frequency coverage and complementarity of the temperature and polarization measurements. Public products based on this measurement include an estimate of the lensing potential over approximately 70\% of the sky, an estimate of the lensing potential power spectrum in bandpowers for the multipole range 40 ≤ L ≤ 400, and an associated likelihood for cosmological parameter constraints. We find good agreement between our measurement of the lensing potential power spectrum and that found in the ΛCDM model that best fits the Planck temperature and polarization power spectra. Using the lensing likelihood alone we obtain a percent-level measurement of the parameter combination σ8Ω0.25m = 0.591 ± 0.021. We combine our determination of the lensing potential with the E-mode polarization, also measured by Planck, to generate an estimate of the lensing B-mode. We show that this lensing B-mode estimate is correlated with the B-modes observed directly by Planck at the expected level and with a statistical significance of 10σ, confirming Planck's sensitivity to this known sky signal. We also correlate our lensing potential estimate with the large-scale temperature anisotropies, detecting a cross-correlation at the 3σ level, as expected because of dark energy in the concordance ΛCDM model.},

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which is dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013. In February 2015, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the second set of cosmology products based ondata from the entire Planck mission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the data products in the release, as well as the associated cosmological and astrophysical science results and papers. The data products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations of signals and noise used in assessing uncertainties and the performance of the analysis methods. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data is described, along with a CMB lensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters derived from CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as constraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark energy, and modified gravity, and new results on low-frequency Galactic foregrounds.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter Ωm = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z\_re=8.8+1.7-1.4. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ mν {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | ΩK | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002{$<$} 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) ∝ φ2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5σ level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Ωch2 = 0.120 ± 0.001, baryon density Ωbh2 = 0.0224 ± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 ± 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 ± 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95\% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03\% precision, with 100θ* = 1.0411 ± 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 ± 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811 ± 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ΛCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to ∑mν {$<$} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ΛCDM at over 2σ, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the ΛCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, ΩK = 0.001 ± 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {$<$} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ΛCDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6σ, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter ΛCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (θ*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the ΛCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

  abstract = {I discuss fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen density of the z≈2.3 intergalactic medium and show that their relation to cosmic overdensity is strongly scale dependent. This behavior arises from a linearized version of the well-known "proximity effect," in which bright sources suppress atomic hydrogen density. Using a novel, systematic and detailed linear-theory radiative-transfer calculation, I demonstrate how Hi density consequently anticorrelates with total matter density when averaged on scales exceeding the Lyman-limit mean-free path. The radiative-transfer thumbprint is highly distinctive and should be measurable in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Effects extend to sufficiently small scales to generate significant distortion of the correlation function shape around the baryon acoustic oscillation peak, although the peak location shifts only by 1.2 percent for a mean source bias of b\textsubscript{j}=3. The distortion changes significantly with b\textsubscript{j} and other astrophysical parameters; measuring it should provide a helpful observational constraint on the nature of ionizing photon sources in the near future. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Improving the use of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) as standard candles requires a better approach to incorporate the relationship between SNIa and the properties of their host galaxies. Using a spectroscopically-confirmed sample of \$\textbackslash sim\$1600 SNIa, we develop the first empirical model of underlying populations for SNIa light-curve properties that includes their dependence on host-galaxy stellar mass. These populations are important inputs to simulations that are used to model selection effects and correct distance biases within the BEAMS with Bias Correction (BBC) framework. Here we improve BBC to also account for SNIa-host correlations, and we validate this technique on simulated data samples. We recover the input relationship between SNIa luminosity and host-galaxy stellar mass (the mass step, \$\textbackslash gamma\$) to within 0.004 mags, which is a factor of 5 improvement over the previous method that results in a \$\textbackslash gamma\$-bias of \$\{\textbackslash sim\}0.02\$. We adapt BBC for a novel dust-based model of intrinsic brightness variations, which results in a greatly reduced mass step for data (\$\textbackslash gamma = 0.017 \textbackslash pm 0.008\$), and for simulations (\$\textbackslash gamma =0.006 \textbackslash pm 0.007\$). Analysing simulated SNIa, the biases on the dark energy equation-of-state, \$w\$, vary from \$\textbackslash Delta w = 0.006(5)\$ to \$0.010(5)\$ with our new BBC method; these biases are significantly smaller than the \$0.02(5)\$ \$w\$-bias using previous BBC methods that ignore SNIa-host correlations.},

  abstract = {The treatment of unknown foreground contaminations will be one of the major challenges for galaxy clustering analyses of coming decadal surveys. These data contaminations introduce erroneous large-scale effects in recovered power spectra and inferred dark matter density fields. In this work, we present an effective solution to this problem in the form of a robust likelihood designed to account for effects due to unknown foreground and target contaminations. Conceptually, this robust likelihood marginalizes over the unknown large-scale contamination amplitudes. We showcase the effectiveness of this novel likelihood via an application to a mock SDSS-III data set subject to dust extinction contamination. In order to illustrate the performance of our proposed likelihood, we infer the underlying dark-matter density field and reconstruct the matter power spectrum, being maximally agnostic about the foregrounds. The results are compared to those of an analysis with a standard Poissonian likelihood, as typically used in modern large-scale structure analyses. While the standard Poissonian analysis yields excessive power for large-scale modes and introduces an overall bias in the power spectrum, our likelihood provides unbiased estimates of the matter power spectrum over the entire range of Fourier modes considered in this work. Further, we demonstrate that our approach accurately accounts for and corrects the effects of unknown foreground contaminations when inferring three-dimensional density fields. Robust likelihood approaches, as presented in this work, will be crucial to control unknown systematic error and maximize the outcome of the decadal surveys.},

Here we present a fully Bayesian approach to infer the three-dimensional cosmic matter distribution and its dynamics at z {$>$} 2 from observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We demonstrate that the method recovers the unbiased mass distribution and the correct matter power spectrum at all scales. Our method infers the three-dimensional density field from a set of one-dimensional spectra, interpolating the information between the lines of sight. We show that our algorithm provides unbiased mass profiles of clusters, becoming an alternative for estimating cluster masses complementary to weak lensing or X-ray observations. The algorithm employs a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to generate realizations of initial and evolved density fields and the three-dimensional large-scale flow, revealing the cosmic dynamics at high redshift. The method correctly handles multi-modal parameter distributions, which allow constraining the physics of the intergalactic medium with high accuracy. We performed several tests using realistic simulated quasar spectra to test and validate our method. Our results show that detailed and physically plausible inference of three-dimensional large-scale structures at high redshift has become feasible.},

  abstract = {High resolution galaxy spectra contain much information about galactic physics, but the high dimensionality of these spectra makes it difficult to fully utilize the information they contain. We apply variational autoencoders (VAEs), a non-linear dimensionality technique, to a sample of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In contrast to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a widely used technique, VAEs can capture non-linear relationships between latent parameters and the data. We find that a VAE can reconstruct the SDSS spectra well with only six latent parameters, outperforming PCA with the same number of components. Different galaxy classes are naturally separated in this latent space, without class labels having been given to the VAE. The VAE latent space is interpretable because the VAE can be used to make synthetic spectra at any point in latent space. For example, making synthetic spectra along tracks in latent space yields sequences of realistic spectra that interpolate between two different types of galaxies. Using the latent space to find outliers may yield interesting spectra: in our small sample, we immediately find unusual data artifacts and stars misclassified as galaxies. In this exploratory work, we show that VAEs create compact, interpretable latent spaces that capture non-linear features of the data and that VAEs can enable the fast exploration of large astronomical data sets.},

This will be a probe of the expansion history of the Universe and gravity at a unique range in redshift. The signal to noise is found to be highly dependent on evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the Universe with a higher H I density resulting in stronger signal. With realistic models for this, SKA Phase 1 should be capable of measuring the lensing power spectrum and its evolution. The dependence of signal to noise on the area and diameter of the array is quantified. We further demonstrate the applications of this technique by applying it to two specific coupled dark energy models that would be difficult to observationally distinguish without information from this range of redshift. We also investigate measuring the lensing signal with 21 cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using SKA and find that it is unlikely to constrain cosmological parameters because of the small survey size, but could provide a map of the dark matter within a small region of the sky.},

Aims: We construct unified empirical models of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function spanning the range of redshifts and line luminosities relevant to the redshift surveys proposed with Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA. Methods: By fitting to observed luminosity functions from H$\alpha$ surveys, we build three models for its evolution. Different fitting methodologies, functional forms for the luminosity function, subsets of the empirical input data, and treatment of systematic errors are considered to explore the robustness of the results.

We explore this technique using a combination of optical photometry from CFHTLS and HST, infrared photometry from the WISE satellite, and spectroscopic or photometric redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey or COSMOS. We present a variety of methods for testing the success of our selection, and present methods for optimization given a set of rest-frame color and redshift requirements. We have tested this selection in two different regions of the sky, the COSMOS and Extended Groth Strip (EGS) fields, to reduce the effect of cosmic/sample variance. We have used these methods to assemble large samples of LRGs for two different ancillary programs as a part of the SDSS-III/ BOSS spectroscopic survey. This technique is now being used to select \$\textbackslash sim\$600,000 LRG targets for SDSS-IV/eBOSS, which began observations in Fall 2014, and will be adapted for the proposed DESI survey. We have found these methods can select high-redshift LRGs efficiently with minimal stellar contamination; this is extremely difficult to achieve with selections that rely on optical photometry alone.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the concepts and procedures of "cognitive conjunction," a new approach to designing and analyzing cognitive activation experiments. Cognitive conjunction compliments categorical approaches such as cognitive subtraction and requires a specific form of statistical inference that involves the conjunction of several hypotheses. While cognitive subtraction studies are designed such that a pair of tasks differ only by the processing component(s) of interest, cognitive conjunction studies are designed such that two or more distinct task pairs each share a common processing difference. The neural correlates of the process of interest are then associated with the common areas of activation for each task pair. There are two main advantages of cognitive conjunction relative to cognitive subtraction. The first is that it provides a greater latitude for selecting baseline tasks because it is not necessary to control for all but the component of interest. The only constraint on selecting the baseline is that the component of interest is the only process that differs in each task pair. The second advantage is that cognitive conjunction does not depend on "pure insertion"--the assumption that the addition of an extra processing component in the activation task has no effect on the implementation of processes that are also engaged by the baseline task. The differences between the design and the statistical analysis of experiments based on cognitive subtraction, cognitive conjunction, and factorial designs are illustrated with a study of phonological retrieval. Cognitive conjunction analysis indicates that irrespective of whether subjects name words, objects, letters, or colors, there is activation of the left posterior basal temporal lobe, the left frontal operculum, the left thalamus, and the midline cerebellum.},

  abstract = {We present a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to reconstruct the initial cosmic matter density field constrained by peculiar velocity observations. As our approach features a model for the gravitational evolution of dark matter to connect the initial conditions to late-time observations, it reconstructs the final density and velocity fields as natural byproducts. We implement this field-based physical inference approach by adapting the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm, which explores the high-dimensional posterior through the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. We test the self-consistency of the method using random sets of mock tracers, and assess its accuracy in a more complex scenario where peculiar velocity tracers are non-linearly evolved mock haloes. We find that our framework self-consistently infers the initial conditions, density and velocity fields, and shows some robustness to model mis-specification. As compared to the state-of-the-art approach of constrained Gaussian random fields/Wiener filtering, our method produces more accurate final density and velocity field reconstructions. It also allows us to constrain the initial conditions by peculiar velocity observations, complementing in this aspect previous field-based approaches based on other cosmological observables.},

EG is a statistic, constructed from a gravitational lensing tracer and a measure of velocities such as redshift-space distortions (RSD), that can discriminate between gravity models while being independent of clustering bias and σ8. While traditionally, the lensing field for EG has been probed through galaxy lensing, CMB lensing has been proposed as a more robust tracer of the lensing field for EG at higher redshifts while avoiding intrinsic alignments. We perform the largest-scale measurement of EG ever, up to 150 Mpc h-1, by cross-correlating the Planck CMB lensing map with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) CMASS galaxy sample and combining this with our measurement of the CMASS auto-power spectrum and the RSD parameter β. We report EG(z = 0.57) = 0.243 ± 0.060 (stat) ± 0.013 (sys), a measurement in tension with the general relativity (GR) prediction at a level of 2.6σ. Note that our EG measurement deviates from GR only at scales greater than 80 Mpc h-1, scales which have not been probed by previous EG tests. Upcoming surveys, which will provide an order-of-magnitude reduction in statistical errors, can significantly constrain alternative gravity models when combined with better control of systematics.},

  abstract = {The line-of-sight peculiar velocities are good indicators of the gravitational fluctuation of the density field. Techniques have been developed to extract cosmological information from the peculiar velocities in order to test the cosmological models. These techniques include measuring cosmic flow, measuring two-point correlation and power spectrum of the peculiar velocity fields, reconstructing the density field using peculiar velocities. However, some measurements from these techniques are biased due to the non-Gaussianity of the estimated peculiar velocities. Therefore, we use the 2MTF survey to explore a power transform that can Gaussianize the estimated peculiar velocities. We find a tight linear relation between the transformation parameters and the measurement errors of log-distance ratio. To show an example for the implement of the Gaussianized peculiar velocities in cosmology, we develop a bulk flow estimator and estimate bulk flow from the Gaussianized peculiar velocities. We use 2MTF mocks to test the algorithm, we find the algorithm yields unbiased measurements. We also find this technique gives smaller measurement errors compared to other techniques. Under the Galactic coordinates, at the depth of \$30\$ \$h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc, we measure a bulk flow of \$332\textbackslash pm27\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ in the direction \$(l,b)=(293\textbackslash pm 5\^\{\textbackslash circ\}, 13\textbackslash pm 4\^\{\textbackslash circ\})\$.

  abstract = {The next generation of galaxy surveys will provide more precise measurements of galaxy clustering than have previously been possible. The 21-cm radio signals that are emitted from neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas will be detected by large-area radio surveys such as WALLABY and the SKA, and deliver galaxy positions and velocities that can be used to measure galaxy clustering statistics. But, to harness this information to improve our cosmological understanding, and learn about the physics of dark matter and dark energy, we need to accurately model the manner in which galaxies detected in HI trace the underlying matter distribution of the Universe. For this purpose, we develop a new HI-based Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, which makes predictions for the number of galaxies present in dark matter halos conditional on their HI mass. The parameterised HOD model is fit and validated using the Dark Sage semi-analytic model, where we show that the HOD parameters can be modelled by simple linear and quadratic functions of HI mass. However, we also find that the clustering predicted by the HOD depends sensitively on the radial distributions of the HI galaxies within their host dark matter halos, which does not follow the NFW profile in the Dark Sage simulation. As such, this work enables -- for the first time -- a simple prescription for placing galaxies of different HI mass within dark matter halos in a way that is able to reproduce the HI mass-dependent galaxy clustering and HI mass function simultaneously and without requiring knowledge of the optical properties of the galaxies. Further efforts are required to demonstrate that this model can be used to produce large ensembles of mock galaxy catalogues for upcoming surveys.},

In this work, we provide new constraints on fσ8 at an effective redshift of z = 0.03 using the combined density and velocity fields measured by the 2MTF and 6dFGSv surveys. We do this by applying a new estimator of the redshift-space density and momentum (density-weighted velocity) power spectra, developed in the first paper of this series, to measured redshifts and peculiar velocities from these data sets. We combine this with models of the density and momentum power spectra in the presence of complex survey geometries and with an ensemble of simulated galaxy catalogues that match the survey selection functions and galaxy bias. We use these simulations to estimate the errors on our measurements and identify possible systematics. In particular, we are able to identify and remove biases caused by the non-Gaussianity of the power spectra by applying the Box-Cox transformation to the power spectra prior to fitting. After thorough validation of our methods we recover a constraint of fσ \_8(z\_\{eff\}=0.03)=0.404\^\{+0.082\}\_\{-0.081\} from the combined 2MTF and 6dFGSv data. This measurement is fully consistent with the expectations of general relativity and the Λ cold dark matter cosmological model. It is also comparable and complementary to constraints using different techniques on similar data, affirming the usefulness of our method for extracting cosmology from velocity fields.},

Our model is trained on photometric information only, eliminating the need for accurate redshift data. Photometric data is pre-processed via 2D Gaussian process regression into two-dimensional images created from flux values at each location in wavelength-time space. These "flux heatmaps" of each supernova detection, along with "uncertainty heatmaps" of the Gaussian process uncertainty, constitute the dataset for our model. This preprocessing step not only smooths over irregular sampling rates between filters but also allows SCONE to be independent of the filter set on which it was trained. Our model has achieved impressive performance without redshift on the in-distribution SNIa classification problem: \$99.73 \textbackslash pm 0.26\$\% test accuracy with no over/underfitting on a subset of supernovae from PLAsTiCC's unblinded test dataset. We have also achieved \$98.18 \textbackslash pm 0.3\$\% test accuracy performing 6-way classification of supernovae by type. The out-of-distribution performance does not fully match the in-distribution results, suggesting that the detailed characteristics of the training sample in comparison to the test sample have a big impact on the performance. We discuss the implication and directions for future work.

  abstract = {We propose an efficient Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating cosmological parameters from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data without the use of likelihood approximations. It builds on a previously developed Gibbs sampling framework that allows for exploration of the joint CMB sky signal and power spectrum posterior, P(\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{s\}\},\{C\}\textsubscript{\{\textbackslash ell \vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}| \{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{d\}\}), and addresses a long-standing problem of efficient parameter estimation simultaneously in regimes of high and low signal-to-noise ratio. To achieve this, our new algorithm introduces a joint Markov chain move in which both the signal map and power spectrum are synchronously modified, by rescaling the map according to the proposed power spectrum before evaluating the Metropolis-Hastings accept probability. Such a move was already introduced by Jewell et al., who used it to explore low signal-to-noise posteriors. However, they also found that the same algorithm is inefficient in the high signal-to-noise regime, since a brute-force rescaling operation does not account for phase information. This problem is mitigated in the new algorithm by subtracting the Wiener filter mean field from the proposed map prior to rescaling, leaving high signal-to-noise information invariant in the joint step, and effectively only rescaling the low signal-to-noise component. To explore the full posterior, the new joint move is then interleaved with a standard conditional Gibbs move for the sky map. We apply our new algorithm to simplified simulations for which we can evaluate the exact posterior to study both its accuracy and its performance, and find good agreement with the exact posterior; marginal means agree to ≲0.006σ and standard deviations to better than ̃3\%. The Markov chain correlation length is of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by other standard samplers in the field. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) has mapped out the low-redshift Universe down to K\textsubscript{S} ̃ 14 mag. As its near-infrared photometry primarily probes the featureless Rayleigh-Jeans tail of galaxy spectral energy distributions, colour-based redshift estimation is rather uninformative. Until now, redshift estimates for this data set have relied on optical follow-up suffering from selection biases. Here, we use the newly developed technique of clustering-based redshift estimation to infer the redshift distribution of the 2MASS sources regardless of their optical properties. We characterize redshift distributions of objects from the Extended Source Catalogue as a function of near-infrared colours and brightness and report some observed trends. We also apply the clustering redshift technique to dropout populations, sources with non-detections in one or more near-infrared bands, and present their redshift distributions. Combining all extended sources, we confirm with clustering redshifts that the distribution of this sample extends up to z ̃ 0.35. We perform a similar analysis with the Point Source Catalogue and show that it can be separated into stellar and extragalactic contributions with galaxies reaching z ̃ 0.7. We estimate that the Point Source Catalogue contains 1.6 million extragalactic objects: as many as in the Extended Source Catalogue but probing a cosmic volume 10 times larger.},

  abstract = {We present a new selection technique of producing spectroscopic target catalogues for massive spectroscopic surveys for cosmology. This work was conducted in the context of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), which will use \textasciitilde 200 000 emission line galaxies (ELGs) at 0.6 ≤ z\textsubscript{spec} ≤ 1.0 to obtain a precise baryon acoustic oscillation measurement. Our proposed selection technique is based on optical and near-infrared broad-band filter photometry. We used a training sample to define a quantity, the Fisher discriminant (linear combination of colours), which correlates best with the desired properties of the target: redshift and [Oii] flux. The proposed selections are simply done by applying a cut on magnitudes and this Fisher discriminant. We used public data and dedicated SDSS spectroscopy to quantify the redshift distribution and [Oii] flux of our ELG target selections. We demonstrate that two of our selections fulfil the initial eBOSS/ELG redshift requirements: for a target density of 180 deg\textsuperscript{-2}, \textasciitilde 70\% of the selected objects have 0.6 ≤ z\textsubscript{spec} ≤ 1.0 and only \textasciitilde 1\% of those galaxies in the range 0.6 ≤ z\textsubscript{spec} ≤ 1.0 are expected to have a catastrophic z\textsubscript{spec} estimate. Additionally, the stacked spectra and stacked deep images for those two selections show characteristic features of star-forming galaxies. The proposed approach using the Fisher discriminant could, however, be used to efficiently select other galaxy populations, based on multi-band photometry, providing that spectroscopic information isavailable. This technique could thus be useful for other future massive spectroscopic surveys such as PFS, DESI, and 4MOST.},

  abstract = {We describe the algorithm used to select the emission line galaxy (ELG)  sample at z ∼ 0.85 for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, using photometric data from the DECam Legacy Survey. Our selection is based on a selection box in the g - r versus r - z colour-colour space and a cut on the g-band magnitude, to favour galaxies in the desired redshift range with strong [O II] emission. It provides a target density of 200 deg-2 on the North Galactic Cap and of 240 deg-2 on the South Galactic Cap (SGC), where we use a larger selection box because of deeper imaging. We demonstrate that this selection passes the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey requirements in terms of homogeneity. About 50 000 ELGs have been observed since the observations have started in 2016, September. These roughly match the expected redshift distribution, though the measured efficiency is slightly lower than expected. The efficiency can be increased by enlarging the redshift range and with incoming pipeline improvement. The cosmological forecast based on these first data predict σ \_\{D\_V\}/D\_V = 0.023, in agreement with previous forecasts. Lastly, we present the stellar population properties of the ELG SGC sample. Once observations are completed, this sample will be suited to provide a cosmological analysis at z ∼ 0.85, and will pave the way for the next decade of massive spectroscopic cosmological surveys, which heavily rely on ELGs. The target catalogue over the SGC will be released along with DR14.},

  abstract = {We present results of our Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 11 survey for  low-redshift (z{$<$}1.65) damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) systems in the UV spectra of quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Early Data Release. These quasars have strong intervening Mg II-Fe II systems that are known signatures of high column density neutral gas. In total, including our previous surveys, UV observations of Ly$\alpha$ absorption in 197 Mg II systems with z{$<$}1.65 and rest equivalent width (REW) Wλ27960{$>$}=0.3 Å have now been obtained. The main results are as follows: (1) The success rate of identifying DLAs in a Mg II sample with Wλ27960{$>$}=0.5 Å and Fe II Wλ26000{$>$}=0.5 Å is 36\%+/-6\% and increases to 42\%+/-7\% for systems with Wλ27960/Wλ26000{$<$}2 and Mg I Wλ28520{$>$}0.1 Å. (2) The mean H I column density of Mg II systems with 0.3 Å{$<$}=Wλ27960{$<$}0.6 Å is =(9.7+/-2.2)×1018 cm-2. For the larger REW systems in our sample, =(3.5+/-0.7)×1020 cm-2. (3) The DLA incidence per unit redshift for 0DLA(z)=n0(1+z)γ, where n0=0.044+/-0.005 and γ=1.27+/-0.11. This parameterization is consistent with no evolution for z{$<\sptilde$}2 (ΩΛ=0.7, ΩM=0.3) but exhibits significant evolution for z{$>\sptilde$}2. (4) The cosmological neutral gas mass density due to DLAs is constant in the redshift interval 0.5DLA\textasciitilde 1×10-3. This is larger than Ωgas(z=0) by a factor of \textasciitilde 2. (5) The slope of the H I column density distribution does not change significantly with redshift. However, the low-redshift distribution is marginally flatter due to the higher fraction of high column density systems in our sample. (6) Finally, using the precision of Mg II survey statistics, we show that under the assumption of constant DLA fraction and H I column density suggested by our current sample, there may be evidence of a decreasing ΩDLA from z=0.5 to 0.

Unfortunately, the peculiar velocity field estimated from the most recent Union2.1 compilation suffers from large individual errors, poor sky coverage and low redshift-volume-density. We show that as a result, any naive attempt to calculate the best-fitting bulk flow and its significance will be severely biased. Instead, we introduce an iterative method which calculates the amplitude and the scatter of the direction of the best-fitting bulk flow as deviants are successively removed and take into account the sparsity of the data when estimating the significance of the result. Using 200 supernovae up to a redshift of z = 0.2, we find that while the amplitude of the bulk flow is marginally consistent with the value expected in a Λ cold dark matter universe given the large bias, the scatter of the direction is significantly low (at ≳99.5 per cent C.L.) when compared to random simulations, supporting the quest for a cosmological origin.},

  abstract = {We introduce an ordinal classification algorithm for photometric  redshift estimation, which significantly improves the reconstruction of photometric redshift probability density functions (PDFs) for individual galaxies and galaxy samples. As a use case we apply our method to CFHTLS galaxies. The ordinal classification algorithm treats distinct redshift bins as ordered values, which improves the quality of photometric redshift PDFs, compared with non-ordinal classification architectures. We also propose a new single value point estimate of the galaxy redshift, which can be used to estimate the full redshift PDF of a galaxy sample. This method is competitive in terms of accuracy with contemporary algorithms, which stack the full redshift PDFs of all galaxies in the sample, but requires orders of magnitude less storage space. The methods described in this paper greatly improve the log-likelihood of individual object redshift PDFs, when compared with a popular neural network code (ANNZ). In our use case, this improvement reaches 50 per cent for high-redshift objects (z ≥ 0.75). We show that using these more accurate photometric redshift PDFs will lead to a reduction in the systematic biases by up to a factor of 4, when compared with less accurate PDFs obtained from commonly used methods. The cosmological analyses we examine and find improvement upon are the following: gravitational lensing cluster mass estimates, modelling of angular correlation functions and modelling of cosmic shear correlation functions.},

Over the past two decades, optical spectroscopy with large ground-based telescopes, and more recently ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy from space, have yielded a wealth of information on what appears to be a gaseous, photoionized intergalactic medium (IGM), partly enriched by the products of stellar nucleosynthesis, residing in coherent structures over many hundreds of kiloparsecs. Recent progress with cosmological hydro-simulations based on hierarchical structure formation models has led to important insights into the physical structures giving rise to the forest. If these ideas are correct, a truly inter- and protogalactic medium [at high redshift (z ∼ 3), the main repository of baryons] collapses under the influence of dark matter gravity into flattened or filamentary structures, which are seen in absorption against background QSOs. With decreasing redshift, galaxies forming in the denser regions may contribute an increasing part of the Ly$\alpha$ absorption cross section. Comparisons between large data samples from the new generation of telescopes and artificial Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra from cosmological simulations promise to become a useful cosmological tool.},

It consists of H I absorption spectra along individual lines-of-sight. If the line-of-sight density is large enough, 3D maps of H I absorption can be inferred by tomographic reconstruction. In this article, we investigate the Ly$\alpha$ forest available in the Stripe 82 field (220 deg2), based on the quasar spectra from SDSS Data Release DR16. The density of observed quasar spectra is 37 deg-2 with a mean pixel signal-to-noise ratio of two per angstrom. This study provides an intermediate case between the average SDSS density and that of the much denser but smaller CLAMATO survey. We derive a 3D map of large-scale matter fluctuations from these data, using a Wiener filter technique. The total volume of the map is 0.94 h-3 Gpc3. Its resolution is 13 h-1 Mpc, which is related to the mean transverse distance between nearest lines-of-sight. From this map, we provide a catalog of voids and protocluster candidates in the cosmic web. The map-making and void catalog are compared to simulated eBOSS Stripe 82 observations. A stack over quasar positions provides a visualization of the Ly$\alpha$ forest-quasar cross-correlation. This tomographic reconstruction constitutes the largest-volume high-redshift 3D map of matter fluctuations.},

  abstract = {We use the deep ground-based optical photometry of the Lyman Break  Galaxy (LBG) Survey to derive robust measurements of the faint-end slope ($\alpha$) of the UV luminosity function (LF) at redshifts 1.9 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 3.4. Our sample includes {$>$}2000 spectroscopic redshifts and ≈31000 LBGs in 31 spatially independent fields over a total area of 3261 arcmin2. These data allow us to select galaxies to 0.07L* and 0.10L* at z \textasciitilde{} 2 and z \textasciitilde{} 3, respectively. A maximum-likelihood analysis indicates steep values of $\alpha$(z = 2) = -1.73 ± 0.07 and $\alpha$(z = 3) = -1.73 ± 0.13. This result is robust to luminosity-dependent systematics in the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width and reddening distributions, and is similar to the steep values advocated at z gsim 4, and implies that ≈93\% of the unobscured UV luminosity density at z \textasciitilde{} 2-3 arises from sub-L* galaxies. With a realistic luminosity-dependent reddening distribution, faint to moderately luminous galaxies account for gsim70\% and gsim25\% of the bolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density, respectively, when integrated over 1.9 {$<$}= z {$<$} 3.4. We find a factor of 8-9 increase in the star-formation rate density between z \textasciitilde{} 6 and z \textasciitilde{} 2, due to both a brightening of L* and an increasing dust correction proceeding to lower redshifts. Combining the UV LF with stellar mass estimates suggests a relatively steep low-mass slope of the stellar mass function at high redshift. The previously observed discrepancy between the integral of the star-formation history and stellar mass density measurements at z \textasciitilde{} 2 may be reconciled by invoking a luminosity-dependent reddening correction to the star-formation history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributed by UV-faint galaxies. The steep and relatively constant faint-end slope of the UV LF at z gsim 2 contrasts with the shallower slope inferred locally, suggesting that the evolution in the faint-end slope may be dictated simply by the availability of low-mass halos capable of supporting star formation at z lsim 2. Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

  abstract = {Aims: The interactive software package iCosmo, designed to perform cosmological calculations is described. Methods: iCosmo is a software package to perform interactive cosmological calculations for the low redshift universe. Computing distance measures, the matter power spectrum, and the growth factor is supported for any values of the cosmological parameters. It also computes derived observed quantities for several cosmological probes such as cosmic shear, baryon acoustic oscillations and type Ia supernovae. The associated errors for these observables can be derived for customised surveys, or for pre-set values corresponding to current or planned instruments. The code also allows for the calculation of cosmological forecasts with Fisher matrices which can be manipulated to combine different surveys and cosmological probes. The code is written in the IDL language and thus benefits from the convenient interactive features and scientific library available in this language. iCosmo can also be used as an engine to perform cosmological calculations in batch mode, and forms a convenient adaptive platform for the development of further cosmological modules. With its extensive documentation, it may also serve as a useful resource for teaching and for newcomers in the field of cosmology. Results: The iCosmo package is described with various examples and command sequences. The code is freely available with documentation at http://www.icosmo.org, along with an interactive web interface and is part of the Initiative for Cosmology, a common archive for cosmological resources.},

  abstract = {Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy  surveys offer an attractive method for measuring the build-up of cosmological structure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the Universe and on our theory of gravity. The statistical precision with which redshift-space distortions can now be measured demands better control of our theoretical systematic errors. While many recent studies focus on understanding dark matter clustering in redshift space, galaxies occupy special places in the universe: dark matter haloes. In our detailed study of halo clustering and velocity statistics in 67.5 h-3 Gpc3 of N-body simulations, we uncover a complex dependence of redshift-space clustering on halo bias. We identify two distinct corrections which affect the halo redshift-space correlation function on quasi-linear scales (˜30-80 h-1 Mpc): the non-linear mapping between real-space and redshift-space positions, and the non-linear suppression of power in the velocity divergence field. We model the first non-perturbatively using the scale-dependent Gaussian streaming model, which we show is accurate at the {$<$}0.5 (2) per cent level in transforming real-space clustering and velocity statistics into redshift space on scales s {$>$} 10 (s {$>$} 25) h-1 Mpc for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation functions. The dominant correction to the Kaiser limit in this model scales like b3. We use standard perturbation theory to predict the real-space pairwise halo velocity statistics. Our fully analytic model is accurate at the 2 per cent level only on scales s {$>$} 40 h-1 Mpc for the range of halo masses we studied (with b= 1.4-2.8). We find that recent models of halo redshift-space clustering that neglect the corrections from the bispectrum and higher order terms from the non-linear real-space to redshift-space mapping will not have the accuracy required for current and future observational analyses. Finally, we note that our simulation results confirm the essential but non-trivial assumption that on large scales, the bias inferred from the real-space clustering of haloes is the same as the one that determines their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per cent level.},

  abstract = {We perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III CMASS data release 10 galaxies on scales of ̃0.8-32 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best-fitting Planck Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M ̃ 2 × 10\textsuperscript{13}h\textsuperscript{-1} M\textsubscript{☉} haloes of fσ\textsubscript{8}(z = 0.57) = 0.450 ± 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, fσ\textsubscript{8}(z = 0.57) = 0.447 ± 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck ΛCDM prediction of 0.480 ± 0.010 at the ̃1.9σ level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best-fitting Planck cosmology, we also find that 10 per cent of CMASS galaxies are satellites in haloes of mass M ̃ 6 × 10\textsuperscript{13} h\textsuperscript{-1} M\textsubscript{☉}. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modelling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {NGC 4258 is a critical galaxy for establishing the extragalactic distance scale and estimating the Hubble constant (). Water masers in the nucleus of the galaxy orbit about its supermassive black hole, and very long baseline interferometric observations of their positions, velocities, and accelerations can be modeled to give a geometric estimate of the angular-diameter distance to the galaxy. We have improved the technique to obtain model parameter values, reducing both statistical and systematic uncertainties compared to previous analyses. We find the distance to NGC 4258 to be 7.576 ± 0.082 (stat.) ± 0.076 (sys.) Mpc. Using this as the sole source of calibration of the Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder results in km s−1 Mpc−1, and in concert with geometric distances from Milky Way parallaxes and detached eclipsing binaries in the LMC we find km s−1 Mpc−1. The improved distance to NGC 4258 also provides a new calibration of the tip of the red giant branch of mag, with reduced systematic errors for the determination of compared to the LMC-based calibration, because it is measured on the same Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometric system and through similarly low extinction as SN Ia host halos. The result is km s−1 Mpc−1, in good agreement with the result from the Cepheid route, and there is no difference in when using the same calibration from NGC 4258 and the same SN Ia Hubble diagram intercept to start and end both distance ladders.},

Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics. We document here the target selection algorithms used to create the galaxy samples that comprise BOSS. We also present the algorithms used to create large-scale structure catalogues for the final Data Release (DR12) samples and the associated random catalogues that quantify the survey mask. The algorithms are an evolution of those used by the BOSS team to construct catalogues from earlier data, and have been designed to accurately quantify the galaxy sample.

  abstract = {Robust measurements of cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys rely  on our understanding of systematic effects that impact the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we present, validate, and implement the idea of adopting the systematics mitigation method of artificial neural networks for modelling the relationship between the target galaxy density field and various observational realities including but not limited to Galactic extinction, seeing, and stellar density. Our method by construction allows a wide class of models and alleviates overtraining by performing k-fold cross-validation and dimensionality reduction via backward feature elimination. By permuting the choice of the training, validation, and test sets, we construct a selection mask for the entire footprint. We apply our method on the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) selection from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) Data Release 7 and show that the spurious large-scale contamination due to imaging systematics can be significantly reduced by up-weighting the observed galaxy density using the selection mask from the neural network and that our method is more effective than the conventional linear and quadratic polynomial functions. We perform extensive analyses on simulated mock data sets with and without systematic effects. Our analyses indicate that our methodology is more robust to overfitting compared to the conventional methods. This method can be utilized in the catalogue generation of future spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as eBOSS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to better mitigate observational systematics.},

We attempt to define the logical end point of such surveys by defining not the next galaxy survey but rather the final galaxy survey at near-infrared wavelengths; this would be the galaxy survey that exhausts the information content useful for addressing extant questions. Such a survey would require incredible advances in a number of technologies, and the survey details will depend on the as yet poorly constrained properties of the earliest galaxies. Using an exposure time calculator, we define nominal surveys for extracting the useful information for three science cases: dark energy cosmology, galaxy evolution, and supernovae (SN). We define scaling relations that trade off sky background, telescope aperture, and focal plane size to allow for a survey of a given depth over a given area. For optimistic assumptions, a 280 m telescope with a marginally resolved focal plane of 20 deg2 operating at L2 could potentially exhaust the cosmological information content of galaxies in a 10 yr survey. For galaxy evolution (making use of gravitational lensing to magnify the earliest galaxies) and SN, the same telescope would suffice. We discuss the technological advances needed to complete the last galaxy survey. While the final galaxy survey remains well outside of our technical reach today, we present scaling relations that show how we can progress toward the goal of exhausting the information content encoded in the shapes, positions, and colors of galaxies.},

The combination of high-cadence, deep, wide-field optical photometry from LSST with high-resolution, wide-field optical photometry, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from Euclid will be powerful for addressing a wide range of astrophysical questions. We explore Euclid/LSST synergy, ignoring the political issues associated with data access to focus on the scientific, technical, and financial benefits of coordination. We focus primarily on dark energy cosmology, but also discuss galaxy evolution, transient objects, solar system science, and galaxy cluster studies. We concentrate on synergies that require coordination in cadence or survey overlap, or would benefit from pixel-level co-processing that is beyond the scope of what is currently planned, rather than scientific programs that could be accomplished only at the catalog level without coordination in data processing or survey strategies. We provide two quantitative examples of scientific synergies: the decrease in photo-z errors (benefiting many science cases) when high-resolution Euclid data are used for LSST photo-z determination, and the resulting increase in weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratio from smaller photo-z errors. We briefly discuss other areas of coordination, including high-performance computing resources and calibration data. Finally, we address concerns about the loss of independence and potential cross-checks between the two missions and the potential consequences of not collaborating.},

The objects are all point sources to a limiting magnitude of i = 21.3 from 8417 deg2 of imaging from SDSS Data Release 6 (DR6). This sample extends our previous catalog by using the latest SDSS public release data and probing both ultraviolet (UV)-excess and high-redshift quasars. While the addition of high-redshift candidates reduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to \textasciitilde 80\%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars, which is \textasciitilde 8 times the number of our previous sample and \textasciitilde 10 times the size of the largest spectroscopic quasar catalog. Cross-matching between our photometric catalog and spectroscopic quasar catalogs from both the SDSS and 2dF survey yields 88,879 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. For judicious selection of the most robust UV-excess sources (\textasciitilde 500, 000 objects in all), the efficiency is nearly 97\%—more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. The catalog's completeness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than 70\%, with most missing objects occurring at z {$<$} 0.7 and 2.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.0. In addition to classification information, we provide photometric redshift estimates (typically good to Δz ± 0.3 [2σ]) and cross-matching with radio, X-ray, and proper-motion catalogs. Finally, we consider the catalog's utility for determining the optical luminosity function of quasars and are able to confirm the flattening of the bright-end slope of the quasar luminosity function at z \textasciitilde{} 4 as compared to z \textasciitilde{} 2.},

  abstract = {We use the three-scale framework of Hu et al. to show how the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum depends on the fundamental constants. As expected, the spectrum depends only on dimensionless combinations of the constants, and we emphasize the points that make this generally true for cosmological observables. Our analysis suggests that the CMB spectrum shape is mostly determined by $\alpha$\textsuperscript{2}m\textsubscript{e}/m\textsubscript{p} and by m\textsubscript{p}/m\textsubscript{χ}, the proton-CDM-particle mass ratio. The distance to the last-scattering surface depends on Gm\textsubscript{p}m\textsubscript{χ}/ ħc, so published CMB observational limits on time variations of the constants implicitly assume the time independence of this quantity, as well as a flat-ΛCDM cosmological model. On the other hand, low-redshift baryon-acoustic oscillation, H\textsubscript{0}, and baryon-mass-fraction measurements can be combined with the shape of the CMB spectrum to give information that is largely independent of these assumptions. In particular, we show that the pre-recombination values of Gm\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{χ}/ħc, m\textsubscript{p}/m\textsubscript{χ}, and $\alpha$\textsuperscript{2}m\textsubscript{e}/m\textsubscript{p} are equal to their present values at a precision of \textasciitilde 15\%.},

These include all suitable SNe Ia in the last 40 years at z{$<$}0.01, measured with {$>$}1000 orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of H0. The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in N4258 (here tripling that Cepheid sample), and DEBs in the LMC. The Cepheids were measured with the same WFC3 instrument and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) to negate zeropoint errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and tests of background determinations that show measurements are accurate in the presence of crowding. The SNe calibrate the mag-z relation from the new Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data, with host properties and SN surveys matched to negate differences. We decrease the uncertainty in H0 to 1 km/s/Mpc with systematics. We present a comprehensive set of \textasciitilde 70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, z range, variations in the analysis of dust, metallicity, form of the P-L relation, SN color, flows, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of H(z). Our baseline result from the Cepheid-SN sample is H0=73.04+-1.04 km/s/Mpc, which includes systematics and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN hosts and NGC 4258 with Cepheids and together these yield 72.53+-0.99. Including high-z SN Ia we find H0=73.30+-1.04 with q0=-0.51+-0.024. We find a 5-sigma difference with H0 predicted by Planck+LCDM, with no indication this arises from measurement errors or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining the Hubble constant remains unknown.},

  abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3\% to 2.4\%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ̃300 SNe Ia at z \&lt; 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (I) megamasers in NGC 4258, (II) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (III) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST/FGS, HST/WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos, and (IV) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25 ± 2.51, 72.04 ± 2.67, 76.18 ± 2.37, and 74.50 ± 3.27 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively. Our best estimate of H \textsubscript{0} = 73.24 ± 1.74 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4\% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4σ higher than 66.93 ± 0.62 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} predicted by ΛCDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06 eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1σ relative to the prediction of 69.3 ± 0.7 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H \textsubscript{0} at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of ∆N \textsubscript{eff} ≈ 0.4-1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H \textsubscript{0} from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

These were obtained with the same WFC3 photometric system used to measure extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of SNe Ia. Gyroscopic control of HST was employed to reduce overheads while collecting a large sample of widely separated Cepheids. The Cepheid period-luminosity relation provides a zero-point-independent link with 0.4\% precision between the new 1.2\% geometric distance to the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) measured by Pietrzyński et al. and the luminosity of SNe Ia. Measurements and analysis of the LMC Cepheids were completed prior to knowledge of the new DEB LMC distance. Combined with a refined calibration of the count-rate linearity of WFC3-IR with 0.1\% precision, these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the LMC from 2.5\% to 1.3\%. Using only the LMC DEBs to calibrate the ladder, we find H 0 = 74.22 ± 1.82 km s-1 Mpc-1 including systematic uncertainties, 3\% higher than before for this particular anchor. Combining the LMC DEBs, masers in NGC 4258, and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H 0 = 74.03 ± 1.42 km s-1 Mpc-1, including systematics, an uncertainty of 1.91\%-15\% lower than our best previous result. Removing any one of these anchors changes H 0 by less than 0.7\%. The difference between H 0 measured locally and the value inferred from Planck CMB and ΛCDM is 6.6 ± 1.5 km s-1 Mpc-1 or 4.4σ (P = 99.999\% for Gaussian errors) in significance, raising the discrepancy beyond a plausible level of chance. We summarize independent tests showing that this discrepancy is not attributable to an error in any one source or measurement, increasing the odds that it results from a cosmological feature beyond ΛCDM.},

The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {$<$} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {$>$}= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0 {$<$} 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {$>$} 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 {$>$}= 0.},

Here we report observations of 240 Cepheid variables obtained with the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) Camera 2 through the F160W filter on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The Cepheids are distributed across six recent hosts of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the “maser galaxy” NGC 4258, allowing us to directly calibrate the peak luminosities of the SNe Ia from the precise, geometric distance measurements provided by the masers. New features of our measurement include the use of the same instrument for all Cepheid measurements across the distance ladder and homogeneity of the Cepheid periods and metallicities, thus necessitating only a differential measurement of Cepheid fluxes and reducing the largest systematic uncertainties in the determination of the fiducial SN Ia luminosity. In addition, the NICMOS measurements reduce the effects of differential extinction in the host galaxies by a factor of ∼5 over past optical data. Combined with a greatly expanded set of 240 SNe Ia at z {$<$} 0.1 which define their magnitude-redshift relation, we find H 0 = 74.2 ± 3.6 km s–1 Mpc–1, a 4.8\% uncertainty including both statistical and systematic errors. To independently test the maser calibration, we use 10 individual parallax measurements of Galactic Cepheids obtained with the HST fine guidance sensor and find similar results. We show that the factor of 2.2 improvement in the precision of H 0 is a significant aid to the determination of the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy, w = P/(ρc 2). Combined with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe five-year measurement of Ω M h 2, we find w = –1.12 ± 0.12 independent of any information from high-redshift SNe Ia or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). This result is also consistent with analyses based on the combination of high-redshift SNe Ia and BAO. The constraints on w(z) now including high-redshift SNe Ia and BAO are consistent with a cosmological constant and are improved by a factor of 3 due to the refinement in H 0 alone. We show that future improvements in the measurement of H 0 are likely and should further contribute to multi-technique studies of dark energy.},

The result is a reduction in the uncertainty in H 0 due to steps beyond the first rung of the distance ladder from 3.5\% to 2.3\%. The measurement of H 0 via the geometric distance to NGC 4258 is 74.8 ± 3.1 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 4.1\% measurement including systematic uncertainties. Better precision independent of the distance to NGC 4258 comes from the use of two alternative Cepheid absolute calibrations: (1) 13 Milky Way Cepheids with trigonometric parallaxes measured with HST/fine guidance sensor and Hipparcos and (2) 92 Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud for which multiple accurate and precise eclipsing binary distances are available, yielding 74.4 ± 2.5 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 3.4\% uncertainty including systematics. Our best estimate uses all three calibrations but a larger uncertainty afforded from any two: H 0 = 73.8 ± 2.4 km s-1 Mpc-1 including systematic errors, corresponding to a 3.3\% uncertainty. The improved measurement of H 0, when combined with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 7 year data, results in a tighter constraint on the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy of w = -1.08 ± 0.10. It also rules out the best-fitting gigaparsec-scale void models, posited as an alternative to dark energy. The combined H 0 + WMAP results yield N eff = 4.2 ± 0.7 for the number of relativistic particle species in the early universe, a low-significance excess for the value expected from the three known neutrino flavors.

We built a data set of 1138 quasars by merging several samples from the literature with X-ray measurements at 2 keV and SDSS photometry, which was used to estimate the extinction-corrected 2500 Å flux. We obtained three main results: (1) we checked the nonlinear relation between X-ray and UV luminosities in small redshift bins up to z̃ 6, confirming that the relation holds at all redshifts with the same slope; (2) we built a Hubble diagram for quasars up to z̃ 6, which is well matched to that of supernovae in the common z = 0-1.4 redshift interval and extends the test of the cosmological model up to z̃ 6; and (3) we showed that this nonlinear relation is a powerful tool for estimating cosmological parameters.

The Euclid, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics surveys will further increase the sample size to at least several hundred thousand.

We compare the BOSS results with the predictions of a halo abundance matching (HAM) clustering model that assigns galaxies to dark matter haloes selected from the large BigMultiDark N-body simulation of a flat Λ cold dark matter Planck cosmology. We compare the observational data with the simulated ones on a light cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the simulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks and fibre collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within 1σ errors the observed monopole of the two-point correlation function at all relevant scales: from the smallest scales, 0.5 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, up to scales beyond the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. This model also agrees remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to k ̃ 1 h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}), and the three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection effects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the clustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar-to-halo mass relation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey with the prediction of our clustering model, and find a good agreement within 1σ.

  abstract = {The Lyman-alpha forest provides strong constraints on both cosmological parameters and intergalactic medium astrophysics, which are forecast to improve further with the next generation of surveys including eBOSS and DESI. As is generic in cosmological inference, extracting this information requires a likelihood to be computed throughout a high-dimensional parameter space. Evaluating the likelihood requires a robust and accurate mapping between the parameters and observables, in this case the 1D flux power spectrum. Cosmological simulations enable such a mapping, but due to computational time constraints can only be evaluated at a handful of sample points; "emulators" are designed to interpolate between these. The problem then reduces to placing the sample points such that an accurate mapping is obtained while minimising the number of expensive simulations required. To address this, we introduce an emulation procedure that employs Bayesian optimisation of the training set for a Gaussian process interpolation scheme. Starting with a Latin hypercube sampling (other schemes with good space-filling properties can be used), we iteratively augment the training set with extra simulations at new parameter positions which balance the need to reduce interpolation error while focussing on regions of high likelihood. We show that smaller emulator error from the Bayesian optimisation propagates to smaller widths on the posterior distribution. Even with fewer simulations than a Latin hypercube, Bayesian optimisation shrinks the 95\% credible volume by 90\% and, e.g., the 1σ error on the amplitude of small-scale primordial fluctuations by 38\%. This is the first demonstration of Bayesian optimisation applied to large-scale structure emulation, and we anticipate the technique will generalise to many other probes such as galaxy clustering, weak lensing and 21cm. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We measure this effect as a function of the column density of the HCD absorbers and redshift by measuring three-dimensional (3D) flux power spectra in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Illustris project. Survey pipelines exclude regions containing the largest damping wings. We find that, even after this procedure, there is a scale-dependent correction to the 3D Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum from residual contamination. We model this residual using a simple physical model of the HCD absorbers as linearly biased tracers of the matter density distribution, convolved with their Voigt profiles and integrated over the column density distribution function. We recommend the use of this model over existing models used in data analysis, which approximate the damping wings as top-hats and so miss shape information in the extended wings. The simple `linear Voigt model' is statistically consistent with our simulation results for a mock residual contamination up to small scales (|k| \&lt; 1 h Mpc\^\{-1\}). It does not account for the effect of the highest column density absorbers on the smallest scales (e.g. |k| \&gt; 0.4 h Mpc\^\{-1\} for small damped Lyman-alpha absorbers; HCD absorbers with N(H I) ̃ 10\^\{21\} atoms cm\^\{-2\}). However, these systems are in any case preferentially removed from survey data. Our model is appropriate for an accurate analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations feature.

A simulation pipeline has been implemented to study the performance of lensing reconstruction techniques. We show how well the lensing signal can be reconstructed using the 3D quadratic lensing estimator in Fourier space assuming different survey strategies. The numerical code introduced in this work is capable of dealing with issues that cannot be treated analytically such as the discreteness of visibility measurements and the inclusion of a realistic model for the antennas distribution. This paves the way for future numerical studies implementing more realistic re-ionization models, foreground subtraction schemes, and testing the performance of lensing estimators that take into account the non-Gaussian distribution of HI after re-ionization. If multiple frequency channels covering z ̃ 7-11.6 are combined, Phase 1 of SKA-Low should be able to obtain good quality images of the lensing potential with a total resolution of ̃1.6 arcmin. The SKA-Low Phase 2 should be capable of providing images with high fidelity even using data from z ̃ 7.7 to 8.3. We perform tests aimed at evaluating the numerical implementation of the mapping reconstruction. We also discuss the possibility of measuring an accurate lensing power spectrum.

  abstract = {Although the baryons in the intergalactic medium (IGM) trace dark matter  fluctuations on megaparsec scales, on smaller scales \textasciitilde 100 kpc, fluctuations are suppressed because the finite temperature gas is pressure supported against gravity, analogous to the classical Jeans argument. This Jeans filtering scale, which quantifies the small-scale structure of the IGM, has fundamental cosmological implications. First, it provides a thermal record of heat injected by ultraviolet photons during cosmic reionization events, and thus constrains the thermal and reionization history of the universe. Second, the Jeans scale determines the clumpiness of the IGM, a critical ingredient in models of cosmic reionization. Third, it sets the minimum mass scale for gravitational collapse from the IGM, and hence plays a pivotal role in galaxy formation. Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to measure the Jeans scale via the standard technique of analyzing purely longitudinal Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra, because the thermal Doppler broadening of absorption lines along the line-of-sight, is highly degenerate with Jeans smoothing. In this work, we show that the Jeans filtering scale can be directly measured by characterizing the coherence of correlated Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption in close quasar pairs, with separations small enough \textasciitilde 100 kpc to resolve it. We present a novel technique for this purpose, based on the probability density function (PDF) of phase angle differences of homologous longitudinal Fourier modes in close quasar pair spectra. A Bayesian formalism is introduced based on the phase angle PDF, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques are used to characterize the precision of a hypothetical Jeans scale measurement, and explore degeneracies with other thermal parameters governing the IGM. A semi-analytical model of the Ly$\alpha$ forest is used to generate a large grid (500) of thermal models from a dark matter only simulation. Our full parameter study indicates that a realistic sample of only 20 close quasar pair spectra can pinpoint the Jeans scale to \textasciitilde = 5\% precision, independent of the amplitude T 0 and slope γ of the temperature-density relation of the IGM T=T\_0(\textbackslash rho / \{\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash rho \}\})\^\{\textbackslash gamma -1\}. This exquisite sensitivity arises because even long-wavelength one-dimensional Fourier modes \textasciitilde 10 Mpc, i.e., two orders of magnitude larger than the Jeans scale, are nevertheless dominated by projected small-scale three-dimensional (3D) power. Hence phase angle differences between all modes of quasar pair spectra actually probe the shape of the 3D power spectrum on scales comparable to the pair separation. We show that this new method for measuring the Jeans scale is unbiased and is insensitive to a battery of systematics that typically plague Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements, such as continuum fitting errors, imprecise knowledge of the noise level and/or spectral resolution, and metal-line absorption.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on the angular and photometric redshift, z\_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift 0.4 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) constant mass sample. Utilizing over 112,778 BOSS spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshift catalog for the galaxies in the SDSS DR8 imaging area that, after masking, covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). We investigate fluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of Galactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass, photometric offset, and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the presence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not traditionally masked) effectively remove area. Failing to correct for such stars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlation function, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how one can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing any galaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we apply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errors imparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find that failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a systematic error on w. We measure w, in four z\_phot slices of width 0.05 between 0.45 {$<$} z\_phot {$<$} 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correcting for the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally consistent with a generic LambdaCDM model, at scales up to 60 degrees. At scales greater than 3 degrees and z\_phot {$>$} 0.5, the magnitude of the corrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.},

  abstract = {We present baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale measurements determined from the clustering of 1.2 million massive galaxies with redshifts 0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.75 distributed over 9300 deg\textsuperscript{2}, as quantified by their redshift-space correlation function. In order to facilitate these measurements, we define, describe, and motivate the selection function for galaxies in the final data release (DR12) of the SDSS III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This includes the observational footprint, masks for image quality and Galactic extinction, and weights to account for density relationships intrinsic to the imaging and spectroscopic portions of the survey. We simulate the observed systematic trends in mock galaxy samples and demonstrate that they impart no bias on BAO scale measurements and have a minor impact on the recovered statistical uncertainty. We measure transverse and radial BAO distance measurements in 0.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.5, 0.5 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.75, and (overlapping) 0.4 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.6 redshift bins. In each redshift bin, we obtain a precision that is 2.7 per cent or better on the radial distance and 1.6 per cent or better on the transverse distance. The combination of the redshift bins represents 1.8 per cent precision on the radial distance and 1.1 per cent precision on the transverse distance. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering data set from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al. to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

  abstract = {We analyse the density field of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital  Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) included in the SDSS Data Release Nine (DR9). DR9 includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400 000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3275 deg2. We identify, characterize and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty on large-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of the redshift-space correlation function, ξℓ(s), and the spherically averaged power spectrum, P(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be obtained from these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars and the higher redshift (0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7) galaxy sample (the approximately constant stellar mass threshold 'CMASS' sample) due to imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than the statistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s {$>$} 120 h-1 Mpc or k {$<$} 0.01 h Mpc-1. We find that these errors can be ameliorated by weighting galaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. The clustering of CMASS galaxies found in the Northern and Southern Galactic footprints of the survey generally agrees to within 2σ. We use mock galaxy catalogues that simulate the CMASS selection function to determine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate the radial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic error on ξℓ(s) measurements and that this systematic error is negligible for the spherically averaged correlation function, ξ0. We find a peak in ξ0 at s˜ 200 h-1 Mpc, with a corresponding feature with period ˜0.03 h Mpc-1 in P(k), and find features at least as strong in 4.8 per cent of the mock galaxy catalogues, concluding this feature is likely to be a consequence of cosmic variance. The methods we recommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the CMASS sample are adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, constrain cosmological models using the full shape of ξ0 and measure the rate of structure growth.},

In total, the SDSS DR9 BOSS data include spectroscopic redshifts for over 400 000 galaxies spread over a footprint of more than 3000 deg2. We measure the power spectrum of these galaxies with redshifts 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7 in order to constrain the amount of local non-Gaussianity, f\{\_N\_L\^local\}, in the primordial density field, paying particular attention to the impact of systematic uncertainties. The BOSS galaxy density field is systematically affected by the local stellar density and this influences the ability to accurately measure f\{\_N\_L\^local\}. In the absence of any correction, we find (erroneously) that the probability that f\{\_N\_L\^local\} is greater than zero, P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\} {$>$} 0), is 99.5 per cent. After quantifying and correcting for the systematic bias and including the added uncertainty, we find - 45 {$<$} f\{\_N\_L\^local\} {$<$} 195 at 95 per cent confidence and P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\} {$>$} 0) = 91.0 per cent. A more conservative approach assumes that we have only learnt the k dependence of the systematic bias and allows any amplitude for the systematic correction; we find that the systematic effect is not fully degenerate with that of f\{\_N\_L\^local\}, and we determine that -82 {$<$} f\{\_N\_L\^local\} {$<$} 178 (at 95 per cent confidence) and P(f\{\_N\_L\^local\} {$>$} 0) = 68 per cent. This analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the impact of Galactic foregrounds on f\{\_N\_L\^local\} measurements. We outline the methods that account for these systematic biases and uncertainties. We expect our methods to yield robust constraints on f\{\_N\_L\^local\} for both our own and future large-scale structure investigations.},

  abstract = {We study the clustering of galaxies, as a function of their colour, from  Data Release Ten (DR10) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. DR10 contains 540 505 galaxies with 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7; from these we select 122 967 for a `Blue' sample and 131 969 for a `Red' sample based on k + e corrected (to z = 0.55) r - i colours and i-band magnitudes. The samples are chosen such that both contain more than 100 000 galaxies, have similar redshift distributions and maximize the difference in clustering amplitude. The Red sample has a 40 per cent larger bias than the Blue (bRed/bBlue = 1.39 ± 0.04), implying that the Red galaxies occupy dark matter haloes with an average mass that is 0.5 log10 M⊙ greater. Spherically averaged measurements of the correlation function, ξ0, and the power spectrum are used to locate the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature of both samples. Using ξ0, we obtain distance scales, relative to the distance of our reference Λ cold dark matter cosmology, of 1.010 ± 0.027 for the Red sample and 1.005 ± 0.031 for the Blue. After applying reconstruction, these measurements improve to 1.013 ± 0.020 for the Red sample and 1.008 ± 0.026 for the Blue. For each sample, measurements of ξ0 and the second multipole moment, ξ2, of the anisotropic correlation function are used to determine the rate of structure growth, parametrized by fσ8. We find fσ8, Red = 0.511 ± 0.083, fσ8, Blue = 0.509 ± 0.085 and fσ8, Cross = 0.423 ± 0.061 (from the cross-correlation between the Red and Blue samples). We use the covariance between the bias and growth measurements obtained from each sample and their cross-correlation to produce an optimally combined measurement of fσ8, comb = 0.443 ± 0.055. This result compares favourably to that of the full 0.43 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7 sample (fσ8, full = 0.422 ± 0.051) despite the fact that, in total, we use less than half of the number of galaxies analysed in the full sample measurement. In no instance do we detect significant differences in distance scale or structure growth measurements obtained from the Blue and Red samples. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions and our tests on mock samples, which predict that any colour-dependent systematic uncertainty on the measured BAO position is less than 0.5 per cent.},

Galaxies are chosen to sample the highest mass haloes, with an effective bias of 1.5, allowing us to construct 1000 mock galaxy catalogues (described in Paper II), which we use to estimate statistical errors and test our methods. We use an estimate of the gravitational potential to `reconstruct' the linear density fluctuations, enhancing the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the measured correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting to these measurements, we determine DV(zeff = 0.15) = (664 ± 25)(rd/rd, fid) Mpc; this is a better than 4 per cent distance measurement. This `fills the gap' in BAO distance ladder between previously measured local and higher redshift measurements, and affords significant improvement in constraining the properties of dark energy. Combining our measurement with other BAO measurements from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and 6-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey galaxy samples provides a 15 per cent improvement in the determination of the equation of state of dark energy and the value of the Hubble parameter at z = 0 (H0). Our measurement is fully consistent with the Planck results and the Λ cold dark matter concordance cosmology, but increases the tension between Planck+BAO H0 determinations and direct H0 measurements.},

Derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV Data Release 16 (DR16), these catalogues provide the data samples, corrected for observational systematics, and random positions sampling the survey selection function. Combined, they allow large-scale clustering measurements suitable for testing cosmological models. We describe the methods used to create these catalogues for the eBOSS DR16 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Quasar samples. The quasar catalogue contains 343 708 redshifts with 0.8 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.2 over 4808 deg2. We combine 174 816 eBOSS LRG redshifts over 4242 deg2 in the redshift interval 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.0 with SDSS-III BOSS LRGs in the same redshift range to produce a combined sample of 377 458 galaxy redshifts distributed over 9493 deg2. Improved algorithms for estimating redshifts allow that 98 per cent of LRG observations result in a successful redshift, with less than one per cent catastrophic failures (Δz {$>$} 1000 km s-1). For quasars, these rates are 95 and 2 per cent (with Δz {$>$} 3000 km s-1). We apply corrections for trends between the number densities of our samples and the properties of the imaging and spectroscopic data. For example, the quasar catalogue obtains a χ2/DoF = 776/10 for a null test against imaging depth before corrections and a χ2/DoF= 6/8 after. The catalogues, combined with careful consideration of the details of their construction found here-in, allow companion papers to present cosmological results with negligible impact from observational systematic uncertainties.},

  abstract = {We develop a series of N-body data challenges, functional to the final analysis of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16) galaxy sample. The challenges are primarily based on high-fidelity catalogs constructed from the Outer Rim simulation - a large box size realization (3 Gpc/h) characterized by an unprecedented combination of volume and mass resolution, down to 1.85x10\^9 M\_sun/h. We generate synthetic galaxy mocks by populating Outer Rim halos with a variety of halo occupation distribution (HOD) schemes of increasing complexity, spanning different redshift intervals. We then assess the performance of three complementary redshift space distortion (RSD) models in configuration and Fourier space, adopted for the analysis of the complete DR16 eBOSS sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We find all the methods mutually consistent, with comparable systematic errors on the Alcock-Paczynski parameters and the growth of structure, and robust to different HOD prescriptions - thus validating the robustness of the models and the pipelines used for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and full shape clustering analysis. In particular, all the techniques are able to recover a\_par and a\_perp to within 0.9\%, and fsig8 to within 1.5\%. As a by-product of our work, we are also able to gain interesting insights on the galaxy-halo connection. Our study is relevant for the final eBOSS DR16 `consensus cosmology', as the systematic error budget is informed by testing the results of analyses against these high-resolution mocks. In addition, it is also useful for future large-volume surveys, since similar mock-making techniques and systematic corrections can be readily extended to model for instance the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) galaxy sample.},

These measurements are typically obtained from moments of the measured two-point clustering statistics, with respect to the cosine of the angle to the line of sight μ. The position of the BAO features in each moment depends on a combination of DA(z) and H(z), and measuring the positions in two or more moments breaks this parameter degeneracy. We derive analytic formulae for the parameter combinations measured from moments given by Legendre polynomials, power laws and top-hat Wedges in μ, showing explicitly what is being measured by each in real-space for both the correlation function and power spectrum, and in redshift space for the power spectrum. The large volume covered by modern galaxy samples means that the correlation function can be well approximated as having no correlations at different μ on the BAO scale, and that the errors on this scale are approximately independent of μ. Using these approximations, we derive the information content of various moments. We show that measurements made using either the monopole and quadrupole, or the monopole and μ2 power-law moment, are optimal for anisotropic BAO measurements, in that they contain all of the available information using two moments, the minimal number required to measure both H(z) and DA(z). We test our predictions using 600 mock galaxy samples, matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey CMASS sample, finding a good match to our analytic predictions. Our results should enable the optimal extraction of information from future galaxy surveys such as extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Euclid.},

  abstract = {The signature left in quasar spectra by neutral hydrogen in the Universe  allows constraining the sum of the neutrino masses with a better sensitivity than laboratory experiments and may shed new light on the neutrino mass hierarchy and the absolute mass-scale of neutrinos. Constraints on cosmological parameters and on the dark energy equation of state can also be derived from a joint parameter estimation procedure. However, this requires a detailed modeling of the line-of-sight power spectrum of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest on scales ranging from a few to hundreds of megaparsecs, which in turn demands the inclusion and careful treatment of cosmological neutrinos. To this end, we present here a suite of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations with cold dark matter (CDM), baryons and massive neutrinos, specifically targeted for modeling the low-density regions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) as probed by the Ly$\alpha$ forest at high-redshift. The simulations span volumes ranging from (25 h-1 Mpc)3 to (100 h-1 Mpc)3, and were made using either 3 × 1923 ≃ 21 million or 3 × 7683 ≃ 1.4 billion particles. The resolution of the various runs was further enhanced, so that we reached the equivalent of 3 × 30723 ≃ 87 billion particles in a (100 h-1 Mpc)3 box size. The chosen cosmological parameters are compatible with the latest Planck 2013 results, although we also explored the effect of slight variations in the main cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We adopted a particle-type implementation of massive neutrinos, and consider three degenerate species with masses ∑ mν = 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4, and 0.8 eV, respectively. We improved on previous studies in several ways, in particular with updated routines for IGM radiative cooling and heating processes, and initial conditions based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) rather than the Zel'dovich approximation. This allowed us to safely start our runs at relatively low redshift (z = 30), which reduced the shot-noise contamination in the neutrino component and the CPU consumption. In addition to providing technical details on the simulations, we present the first analysis of the nonlinear three- and one-dimensional matter and flux power spectra from these models, and characterize the statistics of the transmitted flux in the Ly$\alpha$ forest including the effect of massive neutrinos. In synergy with recent data from the Baryon Acoustic Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and the Planck satellite, and with a grid of corresponding neutrino-less simulations, our realizations will allow us to constrain cosmological parameters and neutrino masses directly from the Ly$\alpha$ forest with improved sensitivity. In addition, our simulations can be useful for a broader variety of cosmological and astrophysical applications, ranging from the three-dimensional modeling of the Ly$\alpha$ forest to cross-correlations between different probes, studying the expansion history of the Universe including massive neutrinos, and particle-physics related topics. Moreover, while our simulations have been specifically designed to meet the requirements of the BOSS survey, they can also be used for upcoming or future experiments - such as eBOSS and DESI.},

  abstract = {The SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), a five-year spectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg\textsuperscript{2}, achieved first light in late 2009. One of the key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ absorption from the spectra of a sample of \textasciitilde 150,000 z \&gt; 2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter distance at z ≈ 2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the expansion rate of the universe at z \&gt; 2. One of the biggest challenges in achieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars in the redshift range 2.2 \&lt; z \&lt; 3.5, where their colors tend to overlap those of the far more numerous stars. During the first year of the BOSS survey, quasar target selection (QTS) methods were developed and tested to meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg\textsuperscript{-2} in this redshift range, with a goal of 20 out of 40 targets deg\textsuperscript{-2} allocated to the quasar survey. To achieve these surface densities, the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g \&lt;= 22.0 or r \&lt;= 21.85. While detection of the BAO signature in the distribution of Ly$\alpha$ absorption in quasar spectra does not require a uniform target selection algorithm, many other astrophysical studies do. We have therefore defined a uniformly selected subsample of 20 targets deg\textsuperscript{-2}, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50\% (\textasciitilde 10 z \&gt; 2.20 quasars deg\textsuperscript{-2}). This "CORE" subsample will be fixed for Years Two through Five of the survey. For the remaining 20 targets deg\textsuperscript{-2}, we will continue to develop improved selection techniques, including the use of additional data sets beyond the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. In this paper, we describe the evolution and implementation of the BOSS QTS algorithms during the first two years of BOSS operations (through 2011 July), in support of the science investigations based on these data, and we analyze the spectra obtained during the first year. During this year, 11,263 new z \&gt; 2.20 quasars were spectroscopically confirmed by BOSS, roughly double the number of previously known quasars with z \&gt; 2.20. Our current algorithms select an average of 15 z \&gt; 2.20 quasars deg\textsuperscript{-2} from 40 targets deg\textsuperscript{-2} using single-epoch SDSS imaging. Multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can further improve the efficiency and completeness of BOSS QTS.},

The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak location is a statistical tracer that represents, in the standard model, a fixed comoving-length standard ruler. Recent gravitational collapse should modify the metric, rendering the effective scale factor, and thus the BAO standard ruler, spatially inhomogeneous. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we show to high significance (P \&lt; 0.001) that the spatial compression of the BAO peak location increases as the spatial paths' overlap with superclusters increases.

  abstract = {The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is one of the first of a new generation of galaxy redshift surveys that will cover a large range in redshift with sufficient resolution to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations signal. For surveys covering a large redshift range we can no longer ignore cosmological evolution, meaning that either the redshift shells analysed have to be significantly narrower than the survey, or we have to allow for the averaging over evolving quantities. Both of these have the potential to remove signal: analysing small volumes increases the size of the Fourier window function, reducing the large-scale information, while averaging over evolving quantities can, if not performed carefully, remove differential information. It will be important to measure cosmological evolution from these surveys to explore and discriminate between models. We apply a method to optimally extract this differential information to mock catalogues designed to mimic the eBOSS quasar sample. By applying a set of weights to extract redshift-space distortion measurements as a function of redshift, we demonstrate an analysis that does not invoke the problems discussed above. We show that our estimator gives unbiased constraints.},

  abstract = {Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) represent one of the cleanest probes of dark energy, allowing for tests of the cosmological model through the measurement of distance and expansion rate from a 3D galaxy distribution. The signal appears at large scales in the correlation function where linear theory applies, allowing for the construction of accurate models. However, due to the lower number of modes available at these scales, sample variance has a significant impact on the signal, and may sharpen or widen the underlying peak. Therefore, equivalent mock realizations of a galaxy survey present different errors in the position of the peak when uncertainties are estimated from the posterior probability distribution corresponding to the individual mocks. Hence, the posterior width, often quoted as the error in BAO survey measurements, is subject to sample noise. A different definition of the error is provided by the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator, which involves the average over multiple realizations, and is not subject to sample noise. In this work, we reanalyse the main galaxy survey data available for BAO measurements and quantify the impact of the noise component on the error quoted for BAO measurements. We quantify the difference between three definitions of the error: the confidence region computed from a single posterior, the average of the variances of many realizations, and the Fisher matrix prediction assuming a Gaussian likelihood. We also explore the impact of a 'detectability prior' based on the significance of the BAO detection.},

This has been interpreted as being a trace of the reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM): the emitted Ly$\alpha$ photons would be scattered by an increasingly neutral IGM at z \&gt; 6. We study this effect by modeling the ionization and Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the infall region and the IGM around a Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy (LAE), for a spherical halo model with the mean density and radial velocity profiles in the standard ΛCDM cosmological scenario. We find that the expected fast increase of the ionizing background intensity toward the end of the reionization epoch implies a rapid evolution of halo infall regions from being self-shielded against the external ionizing background to being mostly ionized. Whereas self-shielded infall regions can scatter the Ly$\alpha$ photons over a much larger area than the commonly used apertures for observing LAEs, the same infalling gas is no longer optically thick to the Ly$\alpha$ emission line after it is ionized by the external background, making the Ly$\alpha$ emission more compact and brighter within the observed apertures. Based on this simple model, we show that the observed drop in the abundance of LAEs at z \&gt; 6 does not imply a rapid increase with redshift of the fraction of the whole IGM volume that is atomic, but is accounted for by a rapid increase of the neutral fraction in the infall regions around galaxy host halos.},

We construct two models, one in which galaxy colour is stochastic (`AbM' model) as well as a model which contains assembly bias effects (`AgM' model). By confronting the redshift dependent clustering of CMASS with the predictions from our model, we argue that that galaxy colours are not a stochastic process in high-mass haloes. Our results suggest that the colours of galaxies in high-mass haloes are determined by other halo properties besides halo peak velocity and that assembly bias effects play an important role in determining the clustering properties of this sample.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relation between underlying matter distribution and  biased tracers such as galaxies or dark matter halos is essential to extract cosmological information from ongoing or future galaxy redshift surveys. At sufficiently large scales such as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on the basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the "local bias" model in which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in terms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias parameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent studies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal bias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter of fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which corresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the characteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the nonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based model including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power spectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in N -body simulations. The bias renormalization procedure ensures that only one additional term is necessary to be introduced to the power spectrum as a next-to-leading order correction, even if third-order nonlocal bias terms are taken into account. We show that the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum between halo and matter in N -body simulations can be simultaneously well explained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms at k ≲0.1 h /Mpc . Also, the results are in a good agreement with theoretical predictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not perfect. These trend can be found for a wide range of halo mass, 0.7 ≲Mhalo[1 013M⊙/h ]≲20 at various redshifts, 0 ≤z ≤1 . These demonstrations clearly show a failure of the local bias model even at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be consistently included in order to accurately model statistics of halos.},

Light curves, spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variable and transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300 deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised of all transient sources brighter than r ≃ 22.5 mag with no history of variability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed on a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient host galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric classifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light curves that were not observed spectroscopically, using host galaxy redshift information when available. From these observations, 4607 transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae, making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We present a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy properties including stellar masses, star formation rates, and the average stellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2 distance moduli for a total of 1364 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as well as photometric redshifts for a further 624 purely photometric SN Ia candidates. Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Ia sample and assuming a flat ΛCDM cosmology, we determine Ω M = 0.315 ± 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant at 5.7σ.},

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey has identified a large  number of new transient sources in a 300 deg2 region along the celestial equator during its first two seasons of a three-season campaign. Multi-band (ugriz) light curves were measured for most of the sources, which include solar system objects, galactic variable stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), and other astronomical transients. The imaging survey is augmented by an extensive spectroscopic follow-up program to identify SNe, measure their redshifts, and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their environment through spectroscopic diagnostics. During the survey, light curves are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of the SNe, and a selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic observations. In the first two seasons, 476 sources were selected for spectroscopic observations, of which 403 were identified as SNe. For the type Ia SNe, the main driver for the survey, our photometric typing and targeting efficiency is 90\%. Only 6\% of the photometric SN Ia candidates were spectroscopically classified as non-SN Ia instead, and the remaining 4\% resulted in low signal-to-noise, unclassified spectra. This paper describes the search algorithm and the software, and the real-time processing of the SDSS imaging data. We also present the details of the supernova candidate selection procedures and strategies for follow-up spectroscopic and imaging observations of the discovered sources.},

  abstract = {We use the joint measurement of geometry and growth from anisotropic galaxy clustering in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample reported by Reid et al. to constrain dark energy (DE) properties and possible deviations from the general relativity (GR). Assuming GR and taking a prior on the linear matter power spectrum at high redshift from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), anisotropic clustering of the CMASS DR9 galaxies alone constrains Ω\textsubscript{m} = 0.308 ± 0.022 and 100Ω\textsubscript{k} = 5.9 ± 4.8 for w = -1, or w = -0.91 ± 0.12 for Ω\textsubscript{k} = 0. When combined with the full CMB likelihood, the addition of the anisotropic clustering measurements to the spherically averaged baryon acoustic oscillation location increases the constraining power on DE by a factor of 4 in a flat cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology with constant DE equation of state w (giving w = -0.87 ± 0.05). This impressive gain depends on our measurement of both the growth of structure and the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and is not realized when marginalizing over the amplitude of redshift-space distortions. Combining with both the CMB and Type Ia supernovae, we find Ω\textsubscript{m} = 0.281 ± 0.014 and 1000Ω\textsubscript{k} = -9.2 ± 5.0 for w = -1, or w\textsubscript{0} = -1.13 ± 0.12 and w\textsubscript{a} = 0.65 ± 0.36 assuming Ω\textsubscript{k} = 0. Finally, when a ΛCDM background expansion is assumed, the combination of our estimate of the growth rate with previous growth measurements provides tight constraints on the parameters describing possible deviations from GR giving γ = 0.64 ± 0.05. For one-parameter extensions of the flat ΛCDM model, we find a ̃2σ preference either for w \&gt; -1 or slower growth than in GR. However, the data are fully consistent with the concordance model, and evidence for these additional parameters is weaker than 2σ.},

Our sample covers 8498 deg2 and encloses an effective volume of 6 Gpc3 at an effective redshift of bar\{z\} = 0.57. We find fσ8 = 0.441 ± 0.044, H = 93.1 ± 3.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 and DA = 1380 ± 23 Mpc when fitting the growth and expansion rate simultaneously. When we fix the background expansion to the one predicted by spatially flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model in agreement with recent Planck results, we find fσ8 = 0.447 ± 0.028 (6 per cent accuracy). While our measurements are generally consistent with the predictions of ΛCDM and general relativity, they mildly favour models in which the strength of gravitational interactions is weaker than what is predicted by general relativity. Combining our measurements with recent cosmic microwave background data results in tight constraints on basic cosmological parameters and deviations from the standard cosmological model. Separately varying these parameters, we find w = -0.983 ± 0.075 (8 per cent accuracy) and γ = 0.69 ± 0.11 (16 per cent accuracy) for the effective equation of state of dark energy and the growth rate index, respectively. Both constraints are in good agreement with the standard model values of w = -1 and γ = 0.554.},

  abstract = {The simplest theory describing large-scale redshift-space distortions (RSD), based on linear theory and distant galaxies, depends on the growth of cosmological structure, suggesting that strong tests of General Relativity can be constructed from galaxy surveys. As data sets become larger and the expected constraints more precise, the extent to which the RSD follow the simple theory needs to be assessed in order that we do not introduce systematic errors into the tests by introducing inaccurate simplifying assumptions. We study the impact of the sample geometry, non-linear processes, and biases induced by our lack of understanding of the radial galaxy distribution on RSD measurements. Using LasDamas simulations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data, these effects are shown to be important at the level of 20 per cent. Including them, we can accurately model the recovered clustering in these mock catalogues on scales 30 -- 200 Mpc/h. Applying this analysis to robustly measure parameters describing the growth history of the Universe from the SDSS-II data, gives \$f(z=0.25)\textbackslash sigma\_8(z=0.25)=0.3512\textbackslash pm0.0583\$ and \$f(z=0.37)\textbackslash sigma\_8(z=0.37)=0.4602\textbackslash pm0.0378\$ when no prior is imposed on the growth-rate, and the background geometry is assumed to follow a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model with the WMAP + SNIa priors.

A crucial problem caused by these units is related to the normalization of the matter power spectrum, which is commonly characterized in terms of the linear-theory rms mass fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 h−1 Mpc, σ8. This parameter does not correctly capture the impact of h on the amplitude of density fluctuations. We show that the use of σ8 has caused critical misconceptions for both the so-called σ8 tension regarding the consistency between low-redshift probes and cosmic microwave background data and the way in which growth-rate estimates inferred from redshift-space distortions are commonly expressed. We propose to abandon the use of h−1 Mpc units in cosmology and to characterize the amplitude of the matter power spectrum in terms of σ12, defined as the mass fluctuation in spheres of radius 12 Mpc, whose value is similar to the standard σ8 for h∼0.67.},

We implement a new detailed modelling of the effects of non-linearities, bias and redshift-space distortions that can be used to extract unbiased cosmological information from our measurements for scales s ≳ 20 h-1 Mpc. We combined the information from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and Type Ia supernovae samples and found no significant evidence for a deviation from the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model. In particular, these data sets can constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter to wDE = -0.996 ± 0.042 when to be assumed time independent, the curvature of the Universe to Ωk = -0.0007 ± 0.0030 and the sum of the neutrino masses to ∑mν {$<$} 0.25 eV at 95 per cent confidence levels. We explore the constraints on the growth rate of cosmic structures assuming f(z) = Ωm(z)γ and obtain γ = 0.609 ± 0.079, in good agreement with the predictions of general relativity of γ = 0.55. We compress the information of our clustering measurements into constraints on the parameter combinations DV(z)/rd, FAP(z) and fσ8(z) at zeff = 0.38, 0.51 and 0.61 with their respective covariance matrices and find good agreement with the predictions for these parameters obtained from the best-fitting ΛCDM model to the CMB data from the Planck satellite.

  abstract = {We obtain constraints on cosmological parameters from the spherically averaged redshift-space correlation function of the CMASS Data Release 9 (DR9) sample of the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We combine this information with additional data from recent cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. Our results show no significant evidence of deviations from the standard flat Λ cold dark matter model, whose basic parameters can be specified by Ω\textsubscript{m} = 0.285 ± 0.009, 100 Ω\textsubscript{b} = 4.59 ± 0.09, n\textsubscript{s} = 0.961 ± 0.009, H\textsubscript{0} = 69.4 ± 0.8 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} and σ\textsubscript{8} = 0.80 ± 0.02. The CMB+CMASS combination sets tight constraints on the curvature of the Universe, with Ω\textsubscript{k} = -0.0043 ± 0.0049, and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio, for which we find r \&lt; 0.16 at the 95 per cent confidence level (CL). These data show a clear signature of a deviation from scale invariance also in the presence of tensor modes, with n\textsubscript{s} \&lt; 1 at the 99.7 per cent CL. We derive constraints on the fraction of massive neutrinos of f\textsubscript{ν} \&lt; 0.049 (95 per cent CL), implying a limit of ∑m\textsubscript{ν} \&lt; 0.51 eV. We find no signature of a deviation from a cosmological constant from the combination of all data sets, with a constraint of w\textsubscript{DE} = -1.033 ± 0.073 when this parameter is assumed time-independent, and no evidence of a departure from this value when it is allowed to evolve as w\textsubscript{DE}(a) = w\textsubscript{0} + w\textsubscript{a}(1 - a). The achieved accuracy on our cosmological constraints is a clear demonstration of the constraining power of current cosmological observations. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

Our results show no significant evidence for a deviation from the standard Λ cold dark matter model. The combination of the information from our clustering measurements with recent data from the cosmic microwave background is sufficient to constrain the curvature of the Universe to Ωk = 0.0010 ± 0.0029, the total neutrino mass to ∑mν {$<$} 0.23 eV (95 per cent confidence level), the effective number of relativistic species to Neff = 3.31 ± 0.27 and the dark energy equation of state to wDE = -1.051 ± 0.076. These limits are further improved by adding information from Type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations from other samples. In particular, this data set combination is completely consistent with a time-independent dark energy equation of state, in which case we find wDE = -1.024 ± 0.052. We explore the constraints on the growth rate of cosmic structures assuming f(z) = Ωm(z)γ and obtain γ = 0.69 ± 0.15, consistent with the predictions of general relativity of γ = 0.55.},

  abstract = {Cosmic voids are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information about the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an increasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void studies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position errors of ≥50~Mpc~h−1which can render many voids undetectable. We present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys, validate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-z redMaGiC galaxy sample of the DES Science Verification data. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding voids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the line-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-z scatter, the number of voids found in simulated spectroscopic and photometric galaxy catalogues is within 20~per~cent for all transverse void sizes, and indistinguishable for the largest voids (Rv ≥ 70~Mpc~h−1). The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric voids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the algorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range 0.2~\&lt;~z~\&lt;~0.8, we identify 87 voids with comoving radii spanning the range 18–120 Mpc~h−1, and carry out a stacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of 4.4σ, the lensing measurement confirms that the voids are truly underdense in the matter field and hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics in the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the viability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.},

We classify all cosmological parameters into two groups, shape parameters, which determine the shape of \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm L\}(k)\$, and evolution parameters, which only affect its amplitude at any given redshift. We show that the time evolution of \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm L\}(k)\$ in models with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters can be mapped from one to the other by relabelling the redshifts that correspond to the same values of \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{12\}(z)\$, defined as the RMS linear variance in spheres of radius \$12\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. We use N-body simulations to show that the same evolution mapping relation can be applied to the non-linear power spectrum, the halo mass function, or the full density field with high accuracy. The deviations from the exact degeneracy are the result of the different structure formation histories experienced by each model to reach the same value of \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{12\}(z)\$. This relation can be used to drastically reduce the number of parameters required to describe the cosmology dependence of the power spectrum. We show how this degeneracy can be exploited to speed up the inference of parameter constraints from cosmological observations. We also present a new design of an emulator of the non-linear power spectrum whose predictions can be adapted to an arbitrary choice of evolution parameters and redshift.},

Especially designed for massive spectroscopic surveys, it is tested on dark matter halo catalogues extracted from the DEUS-FUR Lambda cold dark matter simulation (Reverdy et al. 2015) to trace the trajectories of up to \{∼ \}207 000 haloes backward in time, well beyond the first-order Lagrangian approximation. The new algorithm successfully recovers the BAO feature in real and redshift space in both the monopole and the anisotropic two-point correlation function, also for anomalous samples showing misplaced or absent signature of BAO. In redshift space, the non-linear displacement parameter ΣNL is reduced from 11.8± 0.3 h\^\{-1\} Mpc at redshift z = 0 to 4.0± 0.5 h\^\{-1\} Mpc at z ≃ 37 after reconstruction. A comparison with the first-order Lagrangian reconstruction is presented, showing that these techniques outperform the linear approximation in recovering an unbiased measurement of the acoustic scale.},

For this purpose, we introduce a new implementation of eFAM that accounts for selection effects, survey footprint, and galaxy bias. We use the reconstructed BAO peak to measure the angular diameter distance, \$D\_\textbackslash mathrm\{A\}(z)r\^\textbackslash mathrm\{fid\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}/r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}\$ , and the Hubble parameter, \$H(z)r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}/r\^\textbackslash mathrm\{fid\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}\$ , normalized to the sound horizon scale for a fiducial cosmology \$r\^\textbackslash mathrm\{fid\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}\$ , at the mean redshift of the sample z = 0.38, obtaining \$D\_\textbackslash mathrm\{A\}(z=0.38)r\^\textbackslash mathrm\{fid\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}/r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}=1090\textbackslash pm 29\$ (Mpc)-1, and \$H(z=0.38)r\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}/r\^\textbackslash mathrm\{fid\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}=83\textbackslash pm 3\$ (km s-1 Mpc-1), in agreement with previous measurements on the same data set. The validation tests, performed using 400 publicly available SDSS-DR12 mock catalogues, reveal that eFAM performs well in reconstructing the 2PCF down to separations of ∼25h-1Mpc, i.e. well into the non-linear regime. Besides, eFAM successfully removes the anisotropies due to redshift-space distortion (RSD) at all redshifts including that of the survey, allowing us to decrease the number of free parameters in the model and fit the full-shape of the back-in-time reconstructed 2PCF well beyond the BAO peak. Recovering the real-space 2PCF, eFAM improves the precision on the estimates of the fitting parameters. When compared with the no-reconstruction case, eFAM reduces the uncertainty of the Alcock-Paczynski distortion parameters $\alpha$⊥ and $\alpha$∥ of about 40 per cent and that on the non-linear damping scale Σ∥ of about 70 per cent. These results show that eFAM can be successfully applied to existing redshift galaxy catalogues and should be considered as a reconstruction tool for next-generation surveys alternative to popular methods based on the Zel'dovich approximation.},

The BOSS-DR12 data set includes 1198 006 massive galaxies spread over the redshift range 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.75. These galaxy samples are categorized in three redshift bins. Using CLPT-GSRSD in our analysis of the combined sample of the three redshift bins, we report measurements of fσ8 for the three redshift bins. We find fσ8 = 0.430 ± 0.054 at zeff = 0.38, fσ8 = 0.452 ± 0.057 at zeff = 0.51 and fσ8 = 0.457 ± 0.052 at zeff = 0.61. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Planck Λ cold dark matter-general relativity. Our constraints on the growth rates of structure in the Universe at different redshifts serve as a useful probe, which can help distinguish between a model of the Universe based on dark energy and models based on modified theories of gravity. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering data set from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al., to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

  abstract = {\emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} is a mission of the European Space Agency that is designed to constrain the properties of dark energy and gravity via weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. It will carry out a wide area imaging and spectroscopy survey (the \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} Wide Survey: EWS) in visible and near-infrared bands, covering approximately 15 000 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} of extragalactic sky in six years. The wide-field telescope and instruments are optimised for pristine point spread function and reduced stray light, producing very crisp images. This paper presents the building of the \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} reference survey: the sequence of pointings of EWS, deep fields, and calibration fields, as well as spacecraft movements followed by \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} as it operates in a step-and-stare mode from its orbit around the Lagrange point L2. Each EWS pointing has four dithered frames; we simulated the dither pattern at the pixel level to analyse the effective coverage. We used up-to-date models for the sky background to define the \emph{Euclid{$<$}i/{$>$} region-of-interest (RoI). The building of the reference survey is highly constrained from calibration cadences, spacecraft constraints, and background levels; synergies with ground-based coverage were also considered. Via purposely built software, we first generated a schedule for the calibrations and deep fields observations. On a second stage, the RoI was tiled and scheduled with EWS observations, using an algorithm optimised to prioritise the best sky areas, produce a compact coverage, and ensure thermal stability. The result is the optimised reference survey RSD\_2021A, which fulfils all constraints and is a good proxy for the final solution. The current EWS covers ≈14 500 deg\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}. The limiting AB magnitudes (5\emph{σ{$<$}i/{$>$} point-like source) achieved in its footprint are estimated to be 26.2 (visible band \emph{I{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{E{$<$}sub/{$>$}) and 24.5 (for near infrared bands \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{E{$<$}sub/{$>$}, \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{E{$<$}sub/{$>$}, \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{E{$<$}sub/{$>$}); for spectroscopy, the H\emph{$\alpha${$<$}i/{$>$} line flux limit is 2 × 10\textsuperscript{−16{$<$}sup/{$>$} erg\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$} cm\textsuperscript{−2{$<$}sup/{$>$} s\textsuperscript{−1{$<$}sup/{$>$} at 1600 nm; and for diffuse emission, the surface brightness limits are 29.8 (visible band) and 28.4 (near infrared bands) mag arcsec\textsuperscript{−2{$<$}sup/{$>$}.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Gravitational lensing deflects the paths of cosmic infrared background (CIB) photons, leaving a measurable imprint on CIB maps. The resulting statistical anisotropy can be used to reconstruct the matter distribution out to the redshifts of CIB sources. To this end, we generalize the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing quadratic estimator to any weakly non-Gaussian source field, by deriving the optimal lensing weights. We point out the additional noise and bias caused by the non-Gaussianity and the "self-lensing" of the source field. We propose methods to reduce, subtract, or model these non-Gaussianities. We show that CIB lensing should be detectable with Planck data and detectable at high significance for future CMB experiments like CCAT-Prime. The CIB thus constitutes a new source image for lensing studies, providing constraints on the amplitude of structure at intermediate redshifts between galaxies and the CMB. CIB lensing measurements will also give valuable information on the star-formation history in the Universe, constraining CIB halo models beyond the CIB power spectrum. By laying out a detailed treatment of lens reconstruction from a weakly non-Gaussian source field, this work constitutes a stepping stone toward lens reconstruction from continuum or line intensity mapping data, such as the Lyman-alpha emission, absorption, and the 21 cm radiation. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 μm map that is a reprocessed composite of  the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 μm data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 μm map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 μm DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 μm flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 μm map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 μm and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 μm (95\% confidence). This integrated flux \textasciitilde 2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 μm emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent developments in perturbative calculations of the nonlinear evolution of large-scale structure, we present an iterative algorithm to reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume starting from the dark matter distribution in real space. In our algorithm, objects are first moved back iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively reduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear initial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative displacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should undo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order infrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in real space. At redshift z=0, we find that after eight iterations the reconstructed density is more than 95\% correlated with the initial density at k≤0.35 hMpc−1. The reconstruction also reduces the power in the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2 orders of magnitude at k≤0.2 hMpc−1, and it extends the range of scales where the full broadband shape of the power spectrum matches linear theory by a factor of 2–3. As a specific application, we consider measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be improved by reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our idealized dark matter simulations, the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.7 at z=0 and by a factor of 2.5 at z=0.6, improving standard BAO reconstruction by 70\% at z=0 and 30\% at z=0.6, and matching the optimal BAO signal and signal-to-noise ratio of the linear density in the same volume. For BAO, the iterative nature of the reconstruction is the most important aspect.},

  abstract = {Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors have been discovered so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an outstanding open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations. In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the Palomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift \$z\textbackslash approx1\$. We present the photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The galaxy mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from \$10\^\{5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11.5\}\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are less pronounced than previously thought. H-poor SLSNe and SNe\textasciitilde Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above \$10\^\{10\}\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of \${$<$}0.4\$ and \${$<$}1\$ solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar population than all other classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low-metallicity \textbackslash textit\{and\} young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN progenitors.},

  abstract = {Redshift-space distortions in galaxy surveys happen along the radial direction, breaking statistical translation invariance. We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only fast fourier transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. the BOSS survey requires about 3 min for ℓ=0 ,2 ,4 power spectra for scales up to k =0.3 h Mpc-1 and about 15 additional min for ℓ=0 ,2 ,4 bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to k =0.2 h Mpc-1 on a single core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible for one to compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved constraints of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.},

  abstract = {Gravitational clustering is an intrinsically nonlinear process that generates significant non-Gaussian signatures in the density field. We consider how these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensing surveys. Non-Gaussian effects not only increase the individual error bars compared to the Gaussian case but, most importantly, lead to nontrivial cross-correlations between different band powers, correlating small-scale band powers both among themselves and with those at large scales. We calculate the power-spectrum covariance matrix in nonlinear perturbation theory (weakly nonlinear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly nonlinear regime), and from numerical simulations in real and redshift space. In particular, we show that the hierarchical Ansatz cannot be strictly valid for the configurations of the trispectrum involved in the calculation of the power-spectrum covariance matrix. We discuss the impact of these results on parameter estimation from power-spectrum measurements and their dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band powers. We show that the non-Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant for scales smaller than the nonlinear scale knl\textasciitilde 0.2 h-1 Mpc-1, depending somewhat on power normalization. Furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deteriorate the determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas its shape is less affected. In weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reduce the importance of non-Gaussian effects. Even so, for background galaxies at redshift z\textasciitilde 1, the non-Gaussian contribution rises significantly around l\textasciitilde 1000 and could become comparable to the Gaussian terms depending upon the power spectrum normalization and cosmology. The projection has another interesting effect: the ratio between non-Gaussian and Gaussian contributions saturates and can even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the three-dimensional field falls faster than k-2.},

  abstract = {Current models of galaxy formation applied to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe have two parts. The first is an accurate solution of the equations of motion for the dark matter caused by gravitational clustering. The second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to the behaviour of baryons inside dark matter haloes. The first uses large, computationally intensive, N-body simulations. We argue that because the second step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtain similar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. We describe an algorithm that is several orders of magnitude faster than N-body simulations, but that is, nevertheless, rather accurate. The algorithm combines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the non-linear density and velocity fields. For two- and three-point statistics the resulting fields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the non-linear regime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. We then show how one can use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions from halo occupation numbers. As a first application, we show that it provides a good description of the clustering of galaxies in the PSCz survey. We also discuss applications to the estimation of non-Gaussian contributions to the error bars and the covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space, for galaxies and dark matter.

  abstract = {We obtain constraints on the variation of the fundamental constants from the full shape of the redshift-space correlation function of a sample of luminous galaxies drawn from the Data Release 9 of the Baryonic Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey. We combine this information with additional data from recent cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and H\textsubscript{0} measurements. We focus on possible variations of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ and the electron mass m\textsubscript{e} in the early Universe, and study the degeneracies between these constants and other cosmological parameters, such as the dark energy equation of state parameter w\textsubscript{DE}, the massive neutrinos fraction f\textsubscript{ν}, the effective number of relativistic species N\textsubscript{eff} and the primordial helium abundance Y\textsubscript{He}. In the case when only one of the fundamental constants is varied, our final bounds are $\alpha$ / $\alpha$ \_0 = 0.9957\_\{-0.0042\}\^\{+0.0041\} and m\_e /(m\_e)\_0 = 1.006\_\{-0.013\}\^\{+0.014\}. For the joint variation of both fundamental constants, our results are $\alpha$ / $\alpha$ \_0 = 0.9901\_\{-0.0054\}\^\{+0.0055\} and m\textsubscript{e}/(m\textsubscript{e})\textsubscript{0} = 1.028 ± 0.019. The variations of $\alpha$ and m\textsubscript{e} from their present values affect the bounds on other cosmological parameters. Although when m\textsubscript{e} is allowed to vary our constraints on w\textsubscript{DE} are consistent with a cosmological constant, when $\alpha$ is treated as a free parameter we find w\textsubscript{DE} = -1.20 ± 0.13; more than 1σ away from its standard value. When f\textsubscript{ν} and $\alpha$ are allowed to vary simultaneously, we find f\textsubscript{ν} \&lt; 0.043 (95 per cent confidence level, CL), implying a limit of ∑m\textsubscript{ν} \&lt; 0.46 eV (95 per cent CL), while for m\textsubscript{e} variation, we obtain f\textsubscript{ν} \&lt; 0.086 (95 per cent CL), which implies ∑m\textsubscript{ν} \&lt; 1.1 eV (95 per cent CL). When N\textsubscript{eff} or Y\textsubscript{He} are considered as free parameters, their simultaneous variation with $\alpha$ provides constraints close to their standard values (when the H\textsubscript{0} prior is not included in the analysis), while when m\textsubscript{e} is allowed to vary, their preferred values are significantly higher. In all cases, our results are consistent with no variations of $\alpha$ or m\textsubscript{e} at the 1σ or 2σ level.},

We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry, and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of 279 PS1 SNe Ia (0.03 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.68) with useful distance estimates of SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), SNLS, and various low-z and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of SNe Ia, consisting of a total of 1048 SNe Ia in the range of 0.01 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.3, which we call the “Pantheon Sample.” When combining Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find \{\{\{Ω \}\}\}m=0.307+/- 0.012 and w=-1.026+/- 0.041 for the wCDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H 0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: \{w\}0=-1.007+/- 0.089 and \{w\}a=-0.222+/- 0.407 for the \{w\}0\{w\}aCDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of 2× in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SNe Ia to measure dark energy.},

  abstract = {Simulations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) surveys are a critical tool for correcting biases in the analysis of SNe Ia to infer cosmological parameters. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations include a thorough treatment of observation history, measurement noise, intrinsic scatter models, and selection effects. In this Letter, we improve simulations with a robust technique to evaluate the underlying populations of SN Ia color and stretch that correlate with luminosity. In typical analyses, the standardized SN Ia brightness is determined from linear “Tripp” relations between the light curve color and luminosity and between stretch and luminosity. However, this solution produces Hubble residual biases because intrinsic scatter and measurement noise result in measured color and stretch values that do not follow the Tripp relation. We find a 10σ bias (up to 0.3 mag) in Hubble residuals versus color and 5σ bias (up to 0.2 mag) in Hubble residuals versus stretch in a joint sample of 920 spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia from PS1, SNLS, SDSS, and several low-z surveys. After we determine the underlying color and stretch distributions, we use simulations to predict and correct the biases in the data. We show that removing these biases has a small impact on the low-z sample, but reduces the intrinsic scatter σ int from 0.101 to 0.083 in the combined PS1, SNLS, and SDSS sample. Past estimates of the underlying populations were too broad, leading to a small bias in the equation of state of dark energy w of Δw = 0.005.},

This effort is one part of a series of works that perform an extensive review of redshifts, peculiar velocities, photometric calibration, and intrinsic-scatter models of SNe Ia. The total number of light curves, which are compiled across 18 different surveys, is a significant increase from the first Pantheon analysis (1048 SNe), particularly at low redshift (\$z\$). Furthermore, unlike in the Pantheon analysis, we include light curves for SNe with \$z{$<$}0.01\$ such that SN systematic covariance can be included in a joint measurement of the Hubble constant (H\$\_0\$) and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter (\$w\$). We use the large sample to compare properties of 151 SNe Ia observed by multiple surveys and 12 pairs/triplets of "SN siblings" - SNe found in the same host galaxy. Distance measurements, application of bias corrections, and inference of cosmological parameters are discussed in the companion paper by Brout et al.

We use the WiggleZ survey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200 000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volume of ̃1 h\textsuperscript{-3} Gpc\textsuperscript{3}. A new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented, which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and which can be easily compared between different surveys. Due to the large cosmic depth of WiggleZ (up to z = 1), we are able to make the first measurement of the transition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. The mean number of galaxies N(\&lt; r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r\textsuperscript{3} within 1 per cent, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1 per cent of D\textsubscript{2} = 3, at radii larger than 71 ± 8 h\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc at z ̃ 0.2, 70 ± 5 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc at z ̃ 0.4, 81 ± 5 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc at z ̃ 0.6 and 75 ± 4 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc at z ̃ 0.8. We demonstrate the robustness of our results against selection function effects, using a Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) N-body simulation and a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. The results are in excellent agreement with both the ΛCDM N-body simulation and an analytical ΛCDM prediction. We can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension below D\textsubscript{2} = 2.97 on scales from ̃80 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc up to the largest scales probed by our measurement, ̃300 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, at 99.99 per cent confidence. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Efficient estimators of Fourier-space statistics for large number of objects rely on fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which are affected by aliasing from unresolved small-scale modes due to the finite FFT grid. Aliasing takes the form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These spurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space statistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient estimates for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under per cent level. We show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, which include the dominant contribution to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the FFT grid and demonstrate that using higher order interpolation kernels than the standard Cloud-In-Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the remaining images. We show that combining fourth-order interpolation with interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases of density perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that have systematic biases below 0.01 per cent all the way to the Nyquist frequency of the grid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased Fourier coefficients for a given grid size and greatly reducing systematics for applications to large cosmological data sets.},

  abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

  abstract = {On large scales a nonlinear transformation of matter density field can  be viewed as a biased tracer of the density field itself. A nonlinear transformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit, giving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a nonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We derive analytic expressions for the large scale bias, the velocity bias and the redshift space distortion (RSD) parameter β, as well as the scale dependent bias from primordial nongaussianity for a general nonlinear transformation. These biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution function (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. The analysis shows that one can view the large scale bias different from unity and primordial nongaussianity bias as a consequence of converting higher order correlations in density into 2-point correlations of its nonlinear transform. Our analysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary bias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale clustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, in which Lyman-$\alpha$ flux F is related to the density perturbation δ via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be expressed as an average over the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux PDF. At z = 2.4 we predict the velocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13+/-0.03. Bias and primordial nongaussianity bias depend on the parameters of the transformation. Measurements of bias can thus be used to constrain these parameters, and for reasonable values of the ionizing background intensity we can match the predictions to observations. Matching to the observed values we predict the ratio of primordial nongaussianity bias to bias to have the opposite sign and lower magnitude than the corresponding values for the highly biased galaxies, but this depends on the model parameters and can also vanish or change the sign.},

The existing LYA power spectrum analysis is supplemented by constraints on the mean flux decrement derived using a principle component analysis for quasar continua, which improves the LYA constraints on the linear power. We find some tension between the WMAP3 and LYA power spectrum amplitudes, at the \textasciitilde 2σ level, which is partially alleviated by the inclusion of other observations: we find σ8 = 0.85 ± 0.02 compared to σ8 = 0.80 ± 0.03 without LYA.

  abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

  abstract = {Large-scale structure distorts the images of background galaxies, which  allows one to measure directly the projected distribution of dark matter in the universe and determine its power spectrum. Here we address the question of how to extract this information from the observations. We derive minimum variance estimators for the projected density reconstruction and its power spectrum and apply them to simulated data sets, showing that they give a good agreement with the theoretical minimum variance expectations. The same estimator can also be applied to the cluster reconstruction, where it remains a useful reconstruction technique, although it is no longer optimal for every application. The method can be generalized to include nonlinear cluster reconstruction and photometric information on redshifts of background galaxies in the analysis. We also address the question of how to obtain directly the three-dimensional power spectrum from the weak lensing data. We derive a minimum variance quadratic estimator, which maximizes the likelihood function for the three-dimensional power spectrum and can be computed either from the measurements directly or from the two-dimensional power spectrum. The estimator correctly propagates the errors and provides a full correlation matrix of the estimates. It can be generalized to the case where redshift distribution depends on the galaxy photometric properties, which allows one to measure both the three-dimensional power spectrum and its time evolution.},

We quantify the agreement between our measurements and the latest CMB data from Planck using the suspiciousness metric, and find them to be consistent within \$0.64 \textbackslash pm 0.07\textbackslash sigma\$. Combining our clustering constraints with the \$3\textbackslash times2\$pt data sample from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 release slightly degrades this agreement to the level of \$1.54 \textbackslash pm 0.10\textbackslash sigma\$, while still showing an overall consistency with Planck. We furthermore study the effect of imposing a Planck - like prior on the parameters that define the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, and find significantly tighter constraints on the parameters that control the evolution of density fluctuations. In particular, the combination of low-redshift data sets prefers a value of the physical dark energy density \$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash rm DE\}=0.335 \textbackslash pm 0.011\$, which is 1.7\$\textbackslash sigma\$ higher than the one preferred by Planck.},

We compare results from various sets of simulations that differ in their force, volume, and mass resolution. We find a consistency within 1.5σ for shift values from different simulations and derive shift $\alpha$(z) - 1 = (0.300 ± 0.015) \%[D(z)/D(0)]2 using our fiducial set. We find a strong correlation with a non-unity slope between shifts in real space and in redshift space and a weak correlation between the initial redshift and low redshift. Density-field reconstruction not only removes the mean shifts and reduces errors on the mean, but also tightens the correlations. After reconstruction, we recover a slope of near unity for the correlation between the real and redshift space and restore a strong correlation between the initial and the low redshifts. We derive propagators and mode-coupling terms from our N-body simulations and compare with the Zel'dovich approximation and the shifts measured from the χ2 fitting, respectively. We interpret the propagator and the mode-coupling term of a nonlinear density field in the context of an average and a dispersion of its complex Fourier coefficients relative to those of the linear density field; from these two terms, we derive a signal-to-noise ratio of the acoustic peak measurement. We attempt to improve our reconstruction method by implementing 2LPT and iterative operations, but we obtain little improvement. The Fisher matrix estimates of uncertainty in the acoustic scale is tested using 5000 h -3 Gpc3 of cosmological Particle-Mesh simulations from Takahashi et al.

  abstract = {The density field reconstruction technique, which was developed to partially reverse the nonlinear degradation of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the galaxy redshift surveys, has been successful in substantially improving the cosmology constraints from recent galaxy surveys such as Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We estimate the efficiency of the reconstruction method as a function of various reconstruction details. To directly quantify the BAO information in nonlinear density fields before and after reconstruction, we calculate the cross-correlations (i.e., propagators) of the pre(post)-reconstructed density field with the initial linear field using a mock galaxy sample that is designed to mimic the clustering of the BOSS CMASS galaxies. The results directly provide the BAO damping as a function of wavenumber that can be implemented into the Fisher matrix analysis. We focus on investigating the dependence of the propagator on a choice of smoothing filters and on two major different conventions of the redshift-space density field reconstruction that have been used in literature. By estimating the BAO signal-to-noise for each case, we predict constraints on the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter using the Fisher matrix analysis. We thus determine an optimal Gaussian smoothing filter scale for the signal-to-noise level of the BOSS CMASS. We also present appropriate BAO fitting models for different reconstruction methods based on the first and second order Lagrangian perturbation theory in Fourier space. Using the mock data, we show that the modified BAO fitting model can substantially improve the accuracy of the BAO position in the best fits as well as the goodness of the fits.},

The cosmic microwave background provides the scale of the oscillations as a standard ruler that can be measured in the clustering of galaxies, thereby yielding the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance as a function of redshift. This, in turn, enables one to probe dark energy. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to study the statistical errors for redshift surveys up to z=3 and report errors on cosmography while marginalizing over a large number of cosmological parameters, including a time-dependent equation of state. With redshift surveys combined with cosmic microwave background satellite data, we achieve errors of 0.037 on ΩX, 0.10 on w(z=0.8), and 0.28 on dw(z)/dz for the cosmological constant model. Models with less negative w(z) permit tighter constraints. We test and discuss the dependence of performance on redshift, survey conditions, and the fiducial model. We find results that are competitive with the performance of future Type Ia supernova surveys. We conclude that redshift surveys offer a promising independent route to the measurement of dark energy.},

We discuss a method to measure the power spectrum amplitude σ\textsubscript{8} and b based on a minimal modelling. We considered a sample of ̃120 000 clusters photometrically selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift range 0.1 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.6. The autocorrelation was studied through the two-point function of a subsample of ̃70 000 clusters; the matter-halo correlation was derived from the weak lensing signal of the subsample of ̃1200 clusters with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey data. We obtained a direct measurement of b, which increases with mass in agreement with predictions of the Λ cold dark matter paradigm. Assuming Ω\textsubscript{M} = 0.3, we found σ\textsubscript{8} = 0.79 ± 0.16. We used the same clusters for measuring both lensing and clustering and the estimate of σ\textsubscript{8} did require neither the mass-richness relation, nor the knowledge of the selection function, nor the modelling of b. With an additional theoretical prior on the bias, we obtained σ\textsubscript{8} = 0.75 ± 0.08.},

  abstract = {We present a method to reconstruct the initial linear-regime matter density field from the late-time non-linearly evolved density field in which we channel the output of standard first-order reconstruction to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our method shows dramatic improvement over the reconstruction of either component alone. We show why CNNs are not well-suited for reconstructing the initial density directly from the late-time density: CNNs are local models, but the relationship between initial and late-time density is not local. Our method leverages standard reconstruction as a preprocessing step, which inverts bulk gravitational flows sourced over very large scales, transforming the residual reconstruction problem from long-range to local and making it ideally suited for a CNN. We develop additional techniques to account for redshift distortions, which warp the density fields measured by galaxy surveys. Our method improves the range of scales of high-fidelity reconstruction by a factor of 2 in wavenumber above standard reconstruction, corresponding to a factor of 8 increase in the number of well-reconstructed modes. In addition, our method almost completely eliminates the anisotropy caused by redshift distortions. As galaxy surveys continue to map the Universe in increasingly greater detail, our results demonstrate the opportunity offered by CNNs to untangle the non-linear clustering at intermediate scales more accurately than ever before.},

We also find no scale dependence in b/r for a volume-limited sample of luminous galaxies (-23.0r{$<$}-21.5). The mean b/r for this sample is Vlim=(2.0+/-0.7)(Ωm/0.27). We split the lens galaxy sample into subsets based on luminosity, color, spectral type, and velocity dispersion and see clear trends of the lensing signal with each of these parameters. The amplitude and logarithmic slope of ξgm increase with galaxy luminosity. For high luminosities (L\textasciitilde 5L*), ξgm deviates significantly from a power law.

  abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project is a dedicated multi-object RM experiment that has spectroscopically monitored a sample of 849 broad-line quasars in a single 7 deg2 field with the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey spectrograph. The RM quasar sample is flux-limited to i psf = 21.7 mag, and covers a redshift range of 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 4.5 without any other cuts on quasar properties. Optical spectroscopy was performed during 2014 January-July dark/gray time, with an average cadence of \textasciitilde 4 days, totaling more than 30 epochs. Supporting photometric monitoring in the g and i bands was conducted at multiple facilities including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the Steward Observatory Bok telescope in 2014, with a cadence of \textasciitilde 2 days and covering all lunar phases. The RM field (R.A., decl. = 14:14:49.00, +53:05:00.0) lies within the CFHT-LS W3 field, and coincides with the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) Medium Deep Field MD07, with three prior years of multi-band PS1 light curves. The SDSS-RM six month baseline program aims to detect time lags between the quasar continuum and broad line region (BLR) variability on timescales of up to several months (in the observed frame) for \textasciitilde 10\% of the sample, and to anchor the time baseline for continued monitoring in the future to detect lags on longer timescales and at higher redshift. SDSS-RM is the first major program to systematically explore the potential of RM for broad-line quasars at z {$>$} 0.3, and will investigate the prospects of RM with all major broad lines covered in optical spectroscopy. SDSS-RM will provide guidance on future multi-object RM campaigns on larger scales, and is aiming to deliver more than tens of BLR lag detections for a homogeneous sample of quasars. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of this program, and outline the science impact expected from the resulting data for RM and general quasar science.},

  abstract = {Quasar emission lines are often shifted from the systemic velocity due to various dynamical and radiative processes in the line-emitting region. The level of these velocity shifts depends both on the line species and on quasar properties. We study velocity shifts for the line peaks (not the centroids) of various narrow and broad quasar emission lines relative to systemic using a sample of 849 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. The coadded (from 32 epochs) spectra of individual quasars have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to measure stellar absorption lines to provide reliable systemic velocity estimates, as well as weak narrow emission lines. The large dynamic range in quasar luminosity (̃2 dex) of the sample allowed us to explore potential luminosity dependence of the velocity shifts. We derive average line peak velocity shifts as a function of quasar luminosity for different lines, and quantify their intrinsic scatter. We further quantify how well the peak velocity can be measured as a function of continuum S/N, and demonstrate that there is no systematic bias in the velocity measurements when S/N is degraded to as low as ̃3 per SDSS pixel (̃ 69 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}\textsuperscript{-1}). Based on the observed line shifts, we provide empirical guidelines on redshift estimation from [O II] λ 3727, [O III] λ 5007, [Ne v] λ 3426, Mg II, C III], He II λ 1640, broad Hβ, C IV, and Si IV, which are calibrated to provide unbiased systemic redshifts in the mean, but with increasing intrinsic uncertainties of 46, 56, 119, 205, 233, 242, 400, 415, and 477 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}\textsuperscript{-1}, in addition to the measurement uncertainties.

  abstract = {We measure the cross-correlation of Atacama Cosmology Telescope CMB lensing convergence maps with quasar maps made from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR8 SDSS-XDQSO photometric catalog. The CMB lensing-quasar cross-power spectrum is detected for the first time at a significance of 3.8 sigma, which directly confirms that the quasar distribution traces the mass distribution at high redshifts z{$>$}1. Our detection passes a number of null tests and systematic checks. Using this cross-power spectrum, we measure the amplitude of the linear quasar bias assuming a template for its redshift dependence, and find the amplitude to be consistent with an earlier measurement from clustering; at redshift z \textasciitilde{} 1.4, the peak of the distribution of quasars in our maps, our measurement corresponds to a bias of b = 2.5 +/- 0.6. With the signal-to-noise ratio on CMB lensing measurements likely to improve by an order of magnitude over the next few years, our results demonstrate the potential of CMB lensing cross-correlations to probe astrophysics at high redshifts.},

  abstract = {The process of density field reconstruction enhances the statistical power of distance scale measurements using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). During this process a fiducial cosmology is assumed in order to convert sky coordinates and redshifts into distances; fiducial bias and redshift-space-distortion parameters are also assumed in this procedure. We analytically assess the impact of incorrect cosmology and bias assumptions on the post-reconstruction power spectra using low-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, deriving general expressions for the incorrectly reconstructed spectra. We find that the BAO peak location appears to shift only by a negligible amount due to wrong assumptions made during reconstruction. However, the shape of the BAO peak and the quadrupole amplitude can be affected by such errors (at the percent- and five-percent-level respectively), which potentially could cause small biases in parameter inference for future surveys; we outline solutions to such complications. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

In this paper, we try to provide an intuitive physical understanding of why this shift occurs, explaining in more pedagogical detail earlier perturbation theory calculations. We find that the shift is mainly due to the following physical effect. A measurement of the BAO scale is more sensitive to regions with long-wavelength overdensities than underdensities, because (due to nonlinear growth and bias) these overdense regions contain larger fluctuations and more tracers and hence contribute more to the total correlation function. In overdense regions the BAO scale shrinks because such regions locally behave as positively curved closed universes, and hence a smaller scale than predicted by linear theory is measured in the total correlation function. Other effects which also contribute to the shift are briefly discussed. We provide approximate analytic expressions for the nonlinear shift including a brief discussion of biased tracers and explain why reconstruction should entirely reverse the shift. Our expressions and findings are in agreement with simulation results, and confirm that nonlinear shifts should not be problematic for next-generation BAO measurements. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function has been the standard statistic for quantifying how galaxies are clustered. The statistic uses the positions of galaxies, but not their properties. Clustering as a function of galaxy property, be it type, luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysing a subset of the full population, the galaxies in the subset chosen because they have a similar range of properties. We explore an alternative technique---marked correlations---in which one weights galaxies by some property or `mark' when measuring clustering statistics. Marked correlations are particularly well-suited to quantifying how the properties of galaxies correlate with their environment. Therefore, measurements of marked statistics, with luminosity, stellar mass, color, star-formation rate, etc. as the mark, permit sensitive tests of galaxy formation models. We make measurements of such marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models to illustrate their utility. These measurements show that close pairs of galaxies are expected to be red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star formation rates. We also show that the simplest unbiased estimator of the particular marked statistic we use extensively is very simple to measure---it does not require construction of a random catalog---and provide an estimate of its variance. Large wide-field surveys of the sky are revolutionizing our view of galaxies and how they evolve. Our results indicate that application of marked statistics to this high quantity of high-quality data will provide a wealth of information about galaxy formation.},

The goal of the BELLS GALLERY Survey is to illuminate dark substructures in galaxy-scale halos by exploiting the small-scale clumpiness of rest-frame far-UV emission in lensed LAEs, and to thereby constrain the slope and normalization of the substructure-mass function. In this paper, we describe in detail the spectroscopic strong-lens selection technique, which is based on methods adopted in the previous Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey, BELLS, and SLACS for the Masses Survey. We present the BELLS GALLERY sample of the 21 highest-quality galaxy-LAE candidates selected from ≈ 1.4× \{10\}\textsuperscript{6} galaxy spectra in the BOSS of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. These systems consist of massive galaxies at redshifts of approximately 0.5 strongly lensing LAEs at redshifts from 2-3. The compact nature of LAEs makes them an ideal probe of dark substructures, with a substructure-mass sensitivity that is unprecedented in other optical strong-lens samples. The magnification effect from lensing will also reveal the structure of LAEs below 100 pc scales, providing a detailed look at the sites of the most concentrated unobscured star formation in the universe.

Over the redshift range 0.026 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.44, COS samples the Lyman continuum and many far-UV emission lines (Ly$\alpha$ λ1216, C IV λ1549, Si IV/O IV] λ1400, N V λ1240, O VI λ1035).

The COS EUV index is similar to that of radio-quiet AGNs in the 2002 HST/FOS survey ($\alpha$ν = -1.57 ± 0.17). We see no Lyman edge (τH I {$<$} 0.03) or He I λ584 emission in the AGN composite. Our 22 AGNs exhibit a substantial range of FUV/EUV spectral indices and a correlation with AGN luminosity and redshift, likely due to observing below the 1000 Å spectral break.

The primary uncertainties in the low-redshift UVB are the contribution from massive stars in galaxies and the LyC escape fraction (\{f\}\textsubscript{\{esc\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}), a highly directional quantity that is difficult to constrain statistically. We suggest that both quasars and low-mass starburst galaxies are important contributors to the ionizing UVB at z\textbackslash lt 2.

This method is based on approximating a ΛCDM-like cosmology as a finite sum of complex power-law universes. The decomposition is naturally achieved using an FFTLog algorithm. For power-law cosmologies, all loop integrals are formally equivalent to loop integrals of massless quantum field theory. These integrals have analytic solutions in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. We provide explicit formulae for the one-loop and the two-loop power spectrum and the one-loop bispectrum. A chief advantage of our approach is that the difficult part of the calculation is cosmology independent, need be done only once, and can be recycled for any relevant predictions. Evaluation of standard loop diagrams then boils down to a simple matrix multiplication. We demonstrate the promise of this method for applications to higher multiplicity/loop correlation functions.},

  abstract = {We develop a configuration-space picture of the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter that clearly explains how it can shift the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale in the galaxy-galaxy correlation function. The shift occurs because the relative velocity is non-zero only within the sound horizon and thus adds to the correlation function asymmetrically about the BAO peak. We further show that in configuration space the relative velocity has a localized, distinctive signature in the three-point galaxy correlation function (3PCF). In particular, we find that a multipole decomposition is a favourable way to isolate the relative velocity in the 3PCF, and that there is a strong signature in the l = 1 multipole for triangles with two sides around the BAO scale. Finally, we investigate a further compression of the 3PCF to a function of only one triangle side that preserves the localized nature of the relative velocity signature while also nicely separating linear from non-linear bias. We expect that this scheme will substantially lessen the computational burden of finding the relative velocity in the 3PCF. The relative velocity's 3PCF signature can be used to correct the shift induced in the galaxy-galaxy correlation function so that no systematic error due to this effect is introduced into the BAO as used for precision cosmology.},

We use eight large dark-matter only simulations onto which we paint the Lyman alpha field using the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation. We argue that this approach should be sufficient for the mean signature on the scales of interest. Our results indicate that Lyman alpha flux provides a good tracer of the underlying dark matter field on large scales and that redshift space distortions are well described by a simple linear theory prescription. We compare Fourier and configuration space approaches to describing the signal and argue that configuration space statistics provide useful data compression. We also investigate the effect of a fluctuating photo-ionizing background using a simplified model and find that such fluctuations do add smooth power on large scales. The acoustic peak position is, however, unaffected for small amplitude fluctuations ({$<$}10\%). Larger amplitude fluctuations make the recovery of the BAO signal more difficult and may degrade the achievable significance of the measurement.},

The angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (F = e\textsuperscript{-τ}) is securely detected out to comoving separations of 60 h\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc, the first detection of flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. A quadrupole distortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities, the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, is also detected at high significance. We obtain a good fit to the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias of the transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard ΛCDM cosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). At 95\% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16 \&lt; b \&lt; 0.24 and redshift-distortion parameter 0.44 \&lt; β \&lt; 1.20, at central redshift z = 2.25, with a well constrained combination b(1+β) = 0.336±0.012. The errors on β are asymmetric, with β = 0 excluded at over 5σ confidence level. The value of β is somewhat low compared to theoretical predictions, and our tests on synthetic data suggest that it is depressed (relative to expectations for the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest alone) by the presence of high column density systems and metal line absorption.

  abstract = {We use the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) to detect and measure the position of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux fluctuations at a redshift zeff = 2.4. The feature is clearly detected at significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model and method of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent with predictions of the standard ΛCDM model. We assess the biases in our method, stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. We fit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple the broadband and acoustic scale information. For an isotropic dilation factor, we measure 100 × ($\alpha$iso ‑ 1) = ‑1.6+2.0 +4.3 +7.4‑2.0 ‑4.1 ‑6.8 (stat.) ±1.0 (syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits) with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flat ΛCDM with Ωm = 0.27, h = 0.7). When fitting separately for the radial and transversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100 × ($\alpha$|| ‑ 1) = ‑1.3+3.5 +7.6 +12.3‑3.3 ‑6.7 ‑10.2 (stat.) ±2.0 (syst.) and 100 × ($\alpha$⊥ ‑ 1) = ‑2.2+7.4 +17‑7.1 ‑15 (stat.) ±3.0 (syst.). The dilation factor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlation coefficient of \textasciitilde{} ‑0.55. Errors become significantly non-Gaussian for deviations over 3 standard deviations from best fit value. Because of the data cuts and analysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previous BAO analysis of the BOSS DR9 Lyman-$\alpha$ sample, providing an important consistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.},

  abstract = {We present the design and performance of the multi-object fiber  spectrographs for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and their upgrade for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Originally commissioned in Fall 1999 on the 2.5 m aperture Sloan Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the spectrographs produced more than 1.5 million spectra for the SDSS and SDSS-II surveys, enabling a wide variety of Galactic and extra-galactic science including the first observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in 2005. The spectrographs were upgraded in 2009 and are currently in use for BOSS, the flagship survey of the third-generation SDSS-III project. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.35 million massive galaxies to redshift 0.7 and Ly$\alpha$ absorption of 160,000 high redshift quasars over 10,000 deg2 of sky, making percent level measurements of the absolute cosmic distance scale of the universe and placing tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. The twin multi-object fiber spectrographs utilize a simple optical layout with reflective collimators, gratings, all-refractive cameras, and state-of-the-art CCD detectors to produce hundreds of spectra simultaneously in two channels over a bandpass covering the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, with a resolving power R = λ/FWHM \textasciitilde{} 2000. Building on proven heritage, the spectrographs were upgraded for BOSS with volume-phase holographic gratings and modern CCD detectors, improving the peak throughput by nearly a factor of two, extending the bandpass to cover 360 nm {$<$} λ {$<$} 1000 nm, and increasing the number of fibers from 640 to 1000 per exposure. In this paper we describe the original SDSS spectrograph design and the upgrades implemented for BOSS, and document the predicted and measured performances.},

It is suggested that the material along the line of sight to PKS 0528-250 is likely to be distributed in several clouds with individual velocity dispersions considerably less than 100 km/s, that the derived abundances probably reflect the total gas-phase abundances of the relevant elements, and that either there is an unusually small dust-to-gas ratio in the absorbing gas or the dust present has different absorption and scattering properties than dust in the Galaxy. The detection of very broad emission lines with a redshift of approximately 2.76 is also discussed.},

We test three models on a series of non-blind mocks, in the OuterRim cosmology, and blind mocks, which have been rescaled to new cosmologies, and investigate the effects of redshift smearing and catastrophic redshifts. We find that for the non-blind mocks, the models are able to recover fσ8 to within 3 per cent and $\alpha$∥ and $\alpha$⊥ to within 1 per cent. The scatter in the measurements is larger for the blind mocks, due to the assumption of an incorrect fiducial cosmology. From this mock challenge, we find that all three models perform well, with similar systematic errors on fσ8, $\alpha$∥, and $\alpha$⊥ at the level of \$\textbackslash sigma \_\{f\textbackslash sigma \_8\}=0.013\$ , \$\textbackslash sigma \_\{\textbackslash alpha \_\textbackslash parallel \}=0.012\$ , and \$\textbackslash sigma \_\{\textbackslash alpha \_\textbackslash bot \}=0.008\$ .

  abstract = {Accurate mock catalogues are essential for assessing systematics in the cosmological analysis of large galaxy surveys. Anisotropic two-point clustering measurements from the same simulation show some scatter for different lines of sight (LOS), but are on average equal, due to cosmic variance. This results in scatter in the measured cosmological parameters. We use the OuterRim N-body simulation halo catalogue to investigate this, considering the 3 simulation axes as LOS. The quadrupole of the 2-point statistics is particularly sensitive to changes in the LOS, with sub-percent level differences in the velocity distributions resulting in \textasciitilde 1.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$ shifts on large scales. Averaging over multiple LOS can reduce the impact of cosmic variance. We derive an expression for the Gaussian cross-covariance between the power spectrum multipole measurements, for any two LOS, including shot noise, and the corresponding reduction in variance in the average measurement. Quadrupole measurements are anti-correlated, and for three orthogonal LOS, the variance on the average measurement is reduced by more than 1/3. We perform a Fisher analysis to predict the corresponding gain in precision on the cosmological parameter measurements, which we compare against a set of 300 extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) emission line galaxy (ELG) EZmocks. The gain in \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, which measures the growth of structure, is also better than 1/3. Averaging over multiple LOS in future mock challenges will allow the RSD models to be constrained with the same systematic error, with less than 3 times the CPU time.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter Ω decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock-Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate non-linear power spectra using this method is available from http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/\textasciitilde res/software.html. Following publication, we will make the power-law simulation data publically available through the Virgo website http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Virgo/.},

For 292 SNe Ia, we measure SB at the location of the SN Ia from publicly available Pan-STARRS (PS1) images. The Hubble residuals are from two recent measurements with low-z SNe Ia that overlap the PS1 footprint: 1) the DES 3-year cosmology analysis, with 120 overlapping low-z SNe Ia from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics surveys and Carnegie Supernova Project, and 2) the PS1 single-telescope analysis, with 172 overlapping low-z SNe Ia from the Foundation Supernova Survey. This study is motivated by previous reports of anomalous inefficiencies and flux scatter for transients on bright galaxies. We compare HR distributions of the bright and faint halves of the SB distribution: the mean HR values differ by Delta HR = 0.031 +- 0.018, consistent with no difference at the 2 sigma level. We also perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for the bright and faint half HR distributions, and conclude that the two distributions are statistically consistent with a KS p-value of 0.07. However, if future studies with larger datasets find Delta HR \textasciitilde{} 0.03 with high significance, this difference would be a leading systematic uncertainty in measurements of the dark energy equation of state, w.},

  abstract = {Measuring the statistics of galaxy peculiar velocities using redshift-space distortions is an excellent way of probing the history of structure formation. Because galaxies are expected to act as test particles within the flow of matter, this method avoids uncertainties due to an unknown galaxy density bias. We show that the parameter combination measured by redshift-space distortions, fσ8mass provides a good test of dark energy models, even without the knowledge of bias or σ8mass required to extract f from this measurement (here f is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate, and σ8mass is the root-mean-square mass fluctuation in spheres with radius 8h−1Mpc). We argue that redshift-space distortion measurements will help to determine the physics behind the cosmic acceleration, testing whether it is related to dark energy or modified gravity, and will provide an opportunity to test possible dark energy clumping or coupling between dark energy and dark matter. If we can measure galaxy bias in addition, simultaneous measurement of both the overdensity and velocity fields can be used to test the validity of equivalence principle, through the continuity equation.},

  abstract = {Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations can accurately predict the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM), but only under the condition of retaining the high spatial resolution necessary to resolve density fluctuations in the IGM. This resolution constraint prohibits simulating large volumes, such as those probed by BOSS and future surveys, like DESI and 4MOST. To overcome this limitation, we present “Iteratively Matched Statistics” (IMS), a novel method to accurately model the Ly$\alpha$ forest with collisionless N-body simulations, where the relevant density fluctuations are unresolved. We use a small-box, high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation to obtain the probability distribution function (PDF) and the power spectrum of the real-space Ly$\alpha$ forest flux. These two statistics are iteratively mapped onto a pseudo-flux field of an N-body simulation, which we construct from the matter density. We demonstrate that our method can reproduce the PDF, line of sight and 3D power spectra of the Ly$\alpha$ forest with good accuracy (7\%, 4\%, and 7\% respectively). We quantify the performance of the commonly used Gaussian smoothing technique and show that it has significantly lower accuracy (20\%-80\%), especially for N-body simulations with achievable mean inter-particle separations in large-volume simulations. In addition, we show that IMS produces reasonable and smooth spectra, making it a powerful tool for modeling the IGM in large cosmological volumes and for producing realistic “mock” skies for Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys.},

We find these surfaces are filled with numerous local minima and large degeneracies that generally confound rapid but "greedy" optimization schemes, even with additional stochastic sampling methods. In order to robustly and efficiently explore these surfaces, we develop BAD-Z [Brisk Annealing-Driven Redshifts (Z)], which combines ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with simulated annealing to sample arbitrarily large, pre-generated grids in approximately constant time. Using a mock catalog of 384,662 objects, we show BAD-Z samples \$\textbackslash sim 40\$ times more efficiently compared to a brute-force counterpart while maintaining similar levels of accuracy.

  abstract = {This report describes the 2014 study by the Science Definition Team (SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

  abstract = {Theoretical uncertainties on non-linear scales are among the main obstacles to exploit the sensitivity of forthcoming galaxy and hydrogen surveys like Euclid or the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Here, we devise a new method to model the theoretical error that goes beyond the usual cut-off on small scales. The advantage of this more efficient implementation of the non-linear uncertainties is tested through a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) forecast of the sensitivity of Euclid and SKA to the parameters of the standard \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, including massive neutrinos with total mass \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$, and to 3 extended scenarios, including 1) additional relativistic degrees of freedom (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$ + \$N\_\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\$), 2) a deviation from the cosmological constant (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$ + \$w\_0\$), and 3) a time-varying dark energy equation of state parameter (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$ + \$\textbackslash left(w\_0,w\_a \textbackslash right)\$). We compare the sensitivity of 14 different combinations of cosmological probes and experimental configurations. For Euclid combined with Planck, assuming a plain cosmological constant, our method gives robust predictions for a high sensitivity to the primordial spectral index \$n\_\{\textbackslash rm s\}\$ (\$\textbackslash sigma(n\_s)=0.00085\$), the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$ (\$\textbackslash sigma(H\_0)=0.141 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm km/s/Mpc\}\$), the total neutrino mass \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$ (\$\textbackslash sigma(M\_\textbackslash nu)=0.020 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm eV\}\$). Assuming dynamical dark energy we get \$\textbackslash sigma(M\_\textbackslash nu)=0.030 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm eV\}\$ for the mass and \$(\textbackslash sigma(w\_0), \textbackslash sigma(w\_a)) = (0.0214, 0.071)\$ for the equation of state parameters. The predicted sensitivity to \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$ is mostly stable against the extensions of the cosmological model considered here. Interestingly, a significant improvement of the constraints on the extended model parameters is also obtained when combining Euclid with a low redshift HI intensity mapping survey by SKA1, demonstrating the importance of the synergy of Euclid and SKA.},

  abstract = {We have performed the largest ever particle simulation of a Milky Way sized dark matter halo, and present the most comprehensive convergence study for an individual dark matter halo carried out thus far. We have also simulated a sample of six ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5kms-1, an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes, with a characteristic density that is typically \textasciitilde 2.6 times larger and increases with decreasing distance from halo centre.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

We use adaptive kernel smoothing to map the velocity field, and compare it to reconstructions based on the redshift space galaxy distributions of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) and the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey (PSCz). With a standard χ2 minimization fit to the models, we find that the PSCz model provides a better fit to the 2MTF velocity field data than does the 2MRS model, and provides a value of β in greater agreement with literature values. However, when we subtract away the monopole deviation in the velocity zero-point between data and model, the 2MRS model also produces a value of β in agreement with literature values. We also calculate the ‘residual bulk flow’: the component of the bulk flow not accounted for by the models. This is ∼250~km~s−1 when performing the standard fit, but drops to ∼150~km~s−1 for both models when the aforementioned monopole offset between data and models is removed. This smaller number is more in line with theoretical expectations, and suggests that the models largely account for the major structures in the nearby Universe responsible for the bulk velocity.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed overview of the cosmological surveys that will be carried out with Phase 1 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1), and the science that they will enable. We highlight three main surveys: a medium-deep continuum weak lensing and low-redshift spectroscopic HI galaxy survey over 5,000 sqdeg; a wide and deep continuum galaxy and HI intensity mapping survey over 20,000 sqdeg from z = 0.35 - 3; and a deep, high-redshift HI intensity mapping survey over 100 sqdeg from z = 3 - 6. Taken together, these surveys will achieve an array of important scientific goals: measuring the equation of state of dark energy out to z \textasciitilde{} 3 with percent-level precision measurements of the cosmic expansion rate; constraining possible deviations from General Relativity on cosmological scales by measuring the growth rate of structure through multiple independent methods; mapping the structure of the Universe on the largest accessible scales, thus constraining fundamental properties such as isotropy, homogeneity, and non-Gaussianity; and measuring the HI density and bias out to z = 6. These surveys will also provide highly complementary clustering and weak lensing measurements that have independent systematic uncertainties to those of optical surveys like LSST and Euclid, leading to a multitude of synergies that can improve constraints significantly beyond what optical or radio surveys can achieve on their own. This document, the 2018 Red Book, provides reference technical specifications, cosmological parameter forecasts, and an overview of relevant systematic effects for the three key surveys, and will be regularly updated by the Cosmology Science Working Group in the run up to start of operations and the Key Science Programme of SKA1.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed overview of the cosmological surveys that we aim to carry out with Phase 1 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1) and the science that they will enable. We highlight three main surveys: a medium-deep continuum weak lensing and low-redshift spectroscopic HI galaxy survey over 5 000 deg2; a wide and deep continuum galaxy and HI intensity mapping (IM) survey over 20 000 deg2 from \$z = 0.35\$ to 3; and a deep, high-redshift HI IM survey over 100 deg2 from \$z = 3\$ to 6. Taken together, these surveys will achieve an array of important scientific goals: measuring the equation of state of dark energy out to \$z ∼ 3\$ with percent-level precision measurements of the cosmic expansion rate; constraining possible deviations from General Relativity on cosmological scales by measuring the growth rate of structure through multiple independent methods; mapping the structure of the Universe on the largest accessible scales, thus constraining fundamental properties such as isotropy, homogeneity, and non-Gaussianity; and measuring the HI density and bias out to \$z = 6\$ . These surveys will also provide highly complementary clustering and weak lensing measurements that have independent systematic uncertainties to those of optical and near-infrared (NIR) surveys like Euclid, LSST, and WFIRST leading to a multitude of synergies that can improve constraints significantly beyond what optical or radio surveys can achieve on their own. This document, the 2018 Red Book, provides reference technical specifications, cosmological parameter forecasts, and an overview of relevant systematic effects for the three key surveys and will be regularly updated by the Cosmology Science Working Group in the run up to start of operations and the Key Science Programme of SKA1.},

  abstract = {We present the Democratic Samples of Supernovae (DSS), a compilation of 775 low-redshift Type Ia and II supernovae (SNe Ia \& II), of which 137 SN Ia distances are derived via the newly developed snapshot distance method. Using the objects in the DSS as tracers of the peculiar-velocity field, we compare against the corresponding reconstruction from the 2M++ galaxy redshift survey. Our analysis -- which takes special care to properly weight each DSS subcatalogue and cross-calibrate the relative distance scales between them -- results in a measurement of the cosmological parameter combination \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.390\_\{-0.022\}\^\{+0.022\}\$ as well as an external bulk flow velocity of \$195\_\{-23\}\^\{+22\}\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ in the direction \$(\textbackslash ell, b) = (292\_\{-7\}\^\{+7\}, -6\_\{-4\}\^\{+5\})\$ deg, which originates from beyond the 2M++ reconstruction. Similarly, we find a bulk flow of \$245\_\{-31\}\^\{+32\}\$ km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ toward \$(\textbackslash ell, b) = (294\_\{-7\}\^\{+7\}, 3\_\{-5\}\^\{+6\})\$ deg on a scale of \$\textbackslash sim 30 h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc if we ignore the reconstructed peculiar-velocity field altogether. Our constraint on \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ -- the tightest derived from SNe to date (considering only statistical error bars), and the only one to utilise SNe II -- is broadly consistent with other results from the literature. We intend for our data accumulation and treatment techniques to become the prototype for future studies that will exploit the unprecedented data volume from upcoming wide-field surveys.},

  abstract = {We present the snapshot distance method (SDM), a modern incarnation of a proposed technique for estimating the distance to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) from minimal observations. Our method, which has become possible owing to recent work in the application of deep learning to SN Ia spectra (we use the deepSIP package), allows us to estimate the distance to an SN Ia from a single optical spectrum and epoch of \$2+\$ passband photometry -- one night's worth of observations (though contemporaneity is not a requirement). Using a compilation of well-observed SNe Ia, we generate snapshot distances across a wide range of spectral and photometric phases, light-curve shapes, photometric passband combinations, and spectrum signal-to-noise ratios. By comparing these estimates to the corresponding distances derived from fitting all available photometry for each object, we demonstrate that our method is robust to the relative temporal sampling of the provided spectroscopic and photometric information, and to a broad range of light-curve shapes that lie within the domain of standard width-luminosity relations. Indeed, the median residual (and asymmetric scatter) between SDM distances derived from two-passband photometry and conventional light-curve-derived distances that utilise all available photometry is \$0.013\_\{-0.143\}\^\{+0.154\}\$ mag. Moreover, we find that the time of maximum brightness and light-curve shape (both of which are spectroscopically derived in our method) are only minimally responsible for the observed scatter. In a companion paper, we apply the SDM to a large number of sparsely observed SNe Ia as part of a cosmological study.},

We identify cosmological voids with radii of 2-12 h-1 Mpc in a large N-body simulation at z = 2.5, and characterize the signal of the high-redshift voids in density and Ly$\alpha$ forest flux. The void properties are similar to what has been found at lower redshifts, but they are smaller and have steeper radial density profiles. Similarly to what has been found for low-redshift voids, the radial velocity profiles have little scatter and agree very well with the linear theory prediction. We run the same void finder on an ideal Ly$\alpha$ flux field and tomographic reconstructions at various spatial samplings. We compare the tomographic map void catalogues to the density void catalogue and find good agreement even with modest-sized voids (r {$>$} 6 h-1 Mpc). Using our simple void-finding method, the configuration of the ongoing COSMOS Lyman Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey covering 1 deg2 would provide a sample of about 100 high-redshift voids. We also provide void-finding forecasts for larger area surveys, and discuss how these void samples can be used to test modified gravity models, study high-redshift void galaxies, and to make an Alcock-Paczynski measurement. To aid future work in this area, we provide public access to our simulation products, catalogues, and sample tomographic flux maps.},

We review our method of creating tomographic flux maps and discuss our new high-performance implementation, which makes large reconstructions computationally feasible. Using a large N-body simulation, we illustrate how protoclusters create large-scale flux decrements, roughly 10 h-1 Mpc across, and how we can use this signal to find them in flux maps. We test the performance of our protocluster finding method by running it on the ideal, noiseless map and tomographic reconstructions from mock surveys, and comparing to the halo catalogue. Using the noiseless map, we find protocluster candidates with about 90 per cent purity, and recover about 75 per cent of the protoclusters that form massive clusters ({$>$}3 × 1014 h-1 M⊙). We construct mock surveys similar to the ongoing COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations survey. While the existing data have an average sightline separation of 2.3 h-1 Mpc, we test separations of 2-6 h-1 Mpc to see what can be tolerated for our application. Using reconstructed maps from small separation mock surveys, the protocluster candidate purity and completeness are very close to what was found in the noiseless case. As the sightline separation increases, the purity and completeness decrease, although they remain much higher than we initially expected. We extended our test cases to mock surveys with an average separation of 15 h-1 Mpc, meant to reproduce high source density areas of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We find that even with such a large sightline separation, the method can still be used to find some of the largest protoclusters.},

We have obtained for this purpose high-quality spectra with the Keck-LRIS spectrograph of red-envelope galaxies in 24 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.0. We complement these Keck spectra with high-quality, publicly available archival spectra from the SPICES and VVDS surveys. We improve over our previous expansion history measurements in Simon et al. (2005) by providing two new determinations of the expansion history: H(z) = 97±62 km sec-1 Mpc-1 at z simeq 0.5 and H(z) = 90±40 km sec-1 Mpc-1 at z simeq 0.9. We discuss the uncertainty in the expansion history determination that arises from uncertainties in the synthetic stellar-population models. We then use these new measurements in concert with cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) measurements to constrain cosmological parameters, with a special emphasis on dark-energy parameters and constraints to the curvature. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of direct H(z) measurements by constraining the dark-energy equation of state parameterized by w0 and wa and allowing for arbitrary curvature. Further, we also constrain, using only CMB and H(z) data, the number of relativistic degrees of freedom to be 4±0.5 and their total mass to be {$<$} 0.2 eV, both at 1σ.}

We discuss the implications of the UV flux turnovers and lack of continuum edges for the structure of accretion disks, AGN mass inflow rates, and luminosities relative to Eddington values.

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2pcf) is the key statistic in structure formation; it measures the clustering of galaxies or other density field tracers. Estimators of the 2pcf, including the standard Landy-Szalay (LS) estimator, evaluate the 2pcf in hard-edged separation bins, which is scientifically inappropriate and results in a poor trade-off between bias and variance. We present a new 2pcf estimator, the Continuous-Function Estimator, which generalizes LS to a continuous representation and obviates binning in separation or any other pair property. Our estimator, inspired by the mathematics of least-squares fitting, replaces binned pair counts with projections onto basis functions; it outputs the best linear combination of basis functions to describe the 2pcf. The choice of basis can take into account the expected form of the 2pcf, as well as its dependence on pair properties other than separation. We show that the Continuous-Function Estimator with a cubic-spline basis better represents the shape of the 2pcf compared to LS. We also estimate directly the baryon acoustic scale, using a small number of physically-motivated basis functions. Critically, this leads to a reduction in the number of mock catalogs required for covariance estimation, which is currently the limiting step in many 2pcf analyses. We discuss further applications of the Continuous-Function Estimator, including determination of the dependence of clustering on galaxy properties and searches for potential inhomogeneities or anisotropies in large-scale structure.},

In 2001 June, the SDSS released to the general astronomical community its early data release, roughly 462 deg2 of imaging data including almost 14 million detected objects and 54,008 follow-up spectra. The imaging data were collected in drift-scan mode in five bandpasses (u, g, r, i, and z); our 95\% completeness limits for stars are 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5, respectively. The photometric calibration is reproducible to 5\%, 3\%, 3\%, 3\%, and 5\%, respectively. The spectra are flux- and wavelength-calibrated, with 4096 pixels from 3800 to 9200 Å at R\textasciitilde 1800.

After a brief background setting the cosmological context for this work, the first part of this review focuses on redshift surveys. The practical issues of how redshift surveys are carried out, and how one turns a distribution of galaxies into a smoothed density field, are discussed. Then follows a description of major redshift surveys that have been done, and the local cosmography out to 8,000 km s−1 that they have mapped. We then discuss in some detail the various quantitative cosmological tests that can be carried out with redshift data. The second half of this review concentrates on peculiar velocity studies, beginning with a thorough review of existing techniques. After discussing the various biases which plague peculiar velocity work, we survey quantitative analyses done with peculiar velocity surveys alone, and finally with the combination of data from both redshift and peculiar velocity surveys. The data presented rule out the standard Cold Dark Matter model, although several variants of Cold Dark Matter with more power on large scales fare better. All the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial density field had a Gaussian distribution, although one cannot rule out broad classes of non-Gaussian models. Comparison of the peculiar velocity and density fields constrains the Cosmological Density Parameter. The results here are consistent with a flat universe with mild biasing of the galaxies relative to dark matter, although open universe models are by no means ruled out.},

  abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r{$<$}=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses μ50{$<$}=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (\textasciitilde 0.1\%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99\%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N{$>$}4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9\%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6\% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

  abstract = {When modelling the ionization of gas in the intergalactic medium after  reionization, it is standard practice to assume a uniform radiation background. This assumption is not always appropriate; models with radiative transfer show that large-scale ionization rate fluctuations can have an observable impact on statistics of the Lyman $\alpha$ forest. We extend such calculations to include beaming of sources, which has previously been neglected but which is expected to be important if quasars dominate the ionizing photon budget. Beaming has two effects: first, the physical number density of ionizing sources is enhanced relative to that directly observed; and secondly, the radiative transfer itself is altered. We calculate both effects in a hard-edged beaming model where each source has a random orientation, using an equilibrium Boltzmann hierarchy in terms of spherical harmonics. By studying the statistical properties of the resulting ionization rate and H I density fields at redshift z ˜ 2.3, we find that the two effects partially cancel each other; combined, they constitute a maximum 5 per cent correction to the power spectrum P\_\{H I\}(k) at k = 0.04 h Mpc-1. On very large scales (k {$<$} 0.01 h Mpc-1) the source density renormalization dominates; it can reduce, by an order of magnitude, the contribution of ionizing shot noise to the intergalactic H I power spectrum. The effects of beaming should be considered when interpreting future observational data sets.},

The evolution of the dark matter fluctuations can be described as a global coordinate transformation caused by the long-wavelength displacement vector acting on short-wavelength matter perturbation undergoing non-linear growth. Using this feature, we investigate the well known cancellation of the high-k solutions in the standard perturbation theory. While the standard perturbation theory naturally satisfies the cancellation of the high-k solutions, some of the recently proposed improved perturbation theories do not guarantee the cancellation. We show that this cancellation clarifies the success of the standard perturbation theory at the 2-loop order in describing the amplitude of the non-linear power spectrum even at high-k regions. {$<$}P /{$>$}We propose an extension of the standard 2-loop level perturbation theory model of the non-linear power spectrum that more accurately models the non-linear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillation than the standard perturbation theory. The model consists of simple and intuitive parts: the non-linear evolution of the smoothed power spectrum without the baryon acoustic oscillations and the non-linear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillations due to the large-scale velocity of dark matter and due to the gravitational attraction between dark matter particles. Our extended model predicts the smoothing parameter of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak at z = 0.35 as \textasciitilde{} 7.7Mpc/h and describes the small non-linear shift in the peak position due to the galaxy random motions. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Differences in clustering properties between galaxy subpopulations complicate the cosmological interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum, but can also provide insights about the physics underlying galaxy formation. To study the nature of this relative clustering, we perform a counts-in-cells analysis of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in which we measure the relative bias between pairs of galaxy subsamples of different luminosities and colours. We use a generalized χ2 test to determine if the relative bias between each pair of subsamples is consistent with the simplest deterministic linear bias model, and we also use a maximum likelihood technique to further understand the nature of the relative bias between each pair. We find that the simple, deterministic model is a good fit for the luminosity-dependent bias on scales above \textasciitilde 2h-1 Mpc, which is good news for using magnitude-limited surveys for cosmology. However, the colour-dependent bias shows evidence for stochasticity and/or non-linearity which increases in strength towards smaller scales, in agreement with previous studies of stochastic bias. Also, confirming hints seen in earlier work, the luminosity-dependent bias for red galaxies is significantly different from that of blue galaxies: both luminous and dim red galaxies have higher bias than moderately bright red galaxies, whereas the biasing of blue galaxies is not strongly luminosity dependent. These results can be used to constrain galaxy formation models and also to quantify how the colour and luminosity selection of a galaxy survey can impact measurements of the cosmological matter power spectrum.},

Our data were acquired with the Green Bank Telescope and span the redshift range 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1 over two fields totalling ≈41 deg2 and 190 h of radio integration time. The dominant synchrotron foregrounds exceed the signal by ˜103, but have fewer degrees of freedom and can be removed efficiently. Even in the presence of residual foregrounds, the auto-power can still be interpreted as an upper bound on the 21 cm signal. Our previous measurements of the cross-correlation of 21 cm intensity and the WiggleZ galaxy survey provide a lower bound. Through a Bayesian treatment of signal and foregrounds, we can combine both fields in auto- and cross-power into a measurement of ΩHI bHI= [0.62+0.23-0.15] × 10-3 at 68 per cent confidence with 9 per cent systematic calibration uncertainty, where ΩHI is the neutral hydrogen (H I) fraction and bHI is the H I bias parameter.

We present its Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph far-UV medium-resolution spectrum, which resolves many spectral features for the first time, allowing study of the quasar itself, the intergalactic medium, and quasar proximity effects. Q0302-003 has a harder intrinsic extreme-UV spectral index than previously claimed, as determined from both a direct fit to the spectrum (yielding $\alpha$ν ≈ -0.8) and the helium-to-hydrogen ion ratio in the quasar's line-of-sight proximity zone. Intergalactic absorption along this sightline shows that the helium Gunn-Peterson trough is largely black in the range 2.87 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.20, apart from ionization due to local sources, indicating that helium reionization has not completed at these redshifts. However, we tentatively report a detection of nonzero flux in the high-redshift trough when looking at low-density regions, but zero flux in higher-density regions. This constrains the He II fraction to be about 1\% in the low-density intergalactic medium (IGM) and possibly a factor of a few higher in the IGM as a whole, suggesting helium reionization has progressed substantially by z \textasciitilde{} 3.1. The Gunn-Peterson trough recovers to a He II Ly$\alpha$ forest at z {$<$} 2.87. We confirm a transmission feature due to the ionization zone around a z = 3.05 quasar just off the sightline, and resolve the feature for the first time.

Here, we summarize the science cases in terms of provisional plans for a 300-night Subaru survey.

In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3\% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth to 6\% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams as faint as V ˜ 22, including stars with V {$<$} 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple $\alpha$-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic stars.

The Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey, conducted from fall 2016 through spring 2017, yielded 1824 SN candidates.

This machine is trained by actual observed cadence and filter combinations such that we can directly input the observed data array into the machine without any interpretation. We tested our model with a dataset from the LSST classification challenge (Deep Drilling Field). Our classifier scores an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for binary classification (SN Ia or non-SN Ia) and 95.3\% accuracy for three-class classification (SN Ia, SN Ibc, or SN II). Application of our binary classification to HSC transient data yields an AUC score of 0.925. With two weeks of HSC data since the first detection, this classifier achieves 78.1\% accuracy for binary classification, and the accuracy increases to 84.2\% with the full dataset.

While the halofit model has frequently been used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low resolution of N-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of an improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution N-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe best-fit cosmological parameters (one-, three-, five-, and seven-year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the N-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumbers (k {$<$}= 30 h Mpc-1) at redshifts 0 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 10, with 5\% precision for k {$<$}= 1 h Mpc-1 at 0 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 10 and 10\% for 1 {$<$}= k {$<$}= 10 h Mpc-1 at 0 {$<$}= z {$<$}= 3.

  abstract = {We spectroscopically detected 838 likely, 448 probable, and 265 possible strong lens candidates within \$\textbackslash approx2\$ million galaxy spectra contained within the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) from the sixteenth data release (DR16) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We apply the spectroscopic detection method of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line Lens Survey (BELLS) and add Gaussian fit information, grading, additional inspection observables, and additional inspection methods to improve our selection method. We observed 477 candidates with lensing evidence within low-resolution images from both the Legacy survey of SDSS-I/II and the DESI Legacy survey, which is \$12\textbackslash\%\$ higher than the percentage of BELLS candidates observed with similar lensing evidence. Our search within the latest and improved reductions of the BOSS survey yielded a \$20\textbackslash\%\$ increase in the number of lens candidates expected from searching all BOSS and eBOSS galaxies. The distribution of target and background redshifts of our candidates is similar to the candidates and confirmed lenses within the BELLS observations. We present our Spectroscopic Identification of Lensing Objects (SILO) candidates in a value-added catalogue (VAC) in SDSS DR16. The examination of these lens candidates in follow-up high-resolution imaging may yield more than twice the lenses found in previous spectroscopic detection surveys within SDSS, which would extend the results of previous lens surveys within SDSS to higher redshifts, constrain models of mass structures in spiral galaxies, and test if including the identification of possible lensing features within low-resolution images has merit to spectroscopic detection programs.},

Our sample is composed of 173,736 ELGs covering an area of 1170 deg2 over the redshift range 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 1.1. We use the Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory in addition to the Gaussian Streaming Redshift-Space Distortions to model the Legendre multipoles of the anisotropic correlation function. We show that the eBOSS ELG correlation function measurement is affected by the contribution of a radial integral constraint that needs to be modelled to avoid biased results. To mitigate the effect from unknown angular systematics, we adopt a modified correlation function estimator that cancels out the angular modes from the clustering. At the effective redshift, zeff = 0.85, including statistical and systematical uncertainties, we measure the linear growth rate of structure fσ8(zeff) = 0.35 ± 0.10, the Hubble distance \$D\_H(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\})/r\_\{\textbackslash rm drag\} = 19.1\^\{+1.9\}\_\{-2.1\}\$ and the comoving angular diameter distance DM(zeff)/rdrag = 19.9 ± 1.0.

Contrary to the models of redshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in the literature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the nonlinear coupling between the density and velocity fields associated with two competitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory for gravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with the monopole and quadrupole power spectra of N-body simulations, and an excellent agreement is achieved over the scales of BAOs. Potential impacts on constraining dark energy and modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are also investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism, particularly focusing on the measurements of the Hubble parameter, angular diameter distance, and growth rate for structure formation. We find that the existing phenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error on measurements of the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter by 1\%-2\% , and the growth-rate parameter by ˜5\%, which would become non-negligible for future galaxy surveys. Correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, and the new prescription for the redshift-space power spectrum including the nonlinear corrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropic BAOs.},

In this approach, density and velocity power spectra are constructed from the regularized expressions of the propagators that reproduce both the resummed behavior in the high-k limit and the standard perturbation theory results at low k. With the help of N-body simulations, we particularly focus on the density field, and show that such a construction gives robust and accurate predictions for both the density power spectrum and the correlation function at percent level in the weakly nonlinear regime. We then present an algorithm that allows accelerated evaluations of all the required diagrams by reducing the computational tasks to one-dimensional integrals. This is achieved by means of precomputed kernel sets defined for appropriately chosen fiducial models. The computational time for two-loop results is then reduced from a few minutes, with the direct method, to a few seconds with the fast one. The robustness and applicability of this method are tested against the power spectrum cosmic emulator from which a wide variety of cosmological models can be explored. The Fortran program with which direct and fast calculations of density power spectra can be done, RegPT, is publicly released as part of this paper.},

The predictions consistently include PT corrections up to the two-loop order and are based on an improved prescription of the redshift-space distortions that properly takes into account their non-Gaussian impact from a systematic low-k expansion. In contrast to the previous studies that partly used standard PT calculations, the present treatment is able to provide a consistent prediction for both power spectra and correlation functions. These results are compared with N-body simulations with which a very good agreement is found up to the quadrupole moment. However, the theoretical predictions for the hexadecapole moment of the power spectra are found to significantly depart from the numerical results at low redshift. We examine this issue and find it to be likely related to an improper modeling of the redshift-space distortions damping effects on which this moment shows large dependence.},

Unlike standard N-body methods, the COLA method can straightforwardly trade accuracy at small-scales in order to gain computational speed without sacrificing accuracy at large scales. This is especially useful for cheaply generating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study galaxy clustering and weak lensing, as those catalogs are essential for performing detailed error analysis for ongoing and future surveys of LSS. As an illustration, we ran a COLA-based N-body code on a box of size 100 Mpc/h with particles of mass ≈ 5 × 10\textsuperscript{9}M\textsubscript{solar}/h. Running the code with only 10 timesteps was sufficient to obtain an accurate description of halo statistics down to halo masses of at least 10\textsuperscript{11}M\textsubscript{solar}/h. This is only at a modest speed penalty when compared to mocks obtained with LPT. A standard detailed N-body run is orders of magnitude slower than our COLA-based code. The speed-up we obtain with COLA is due to the fact that we calculate the large-scale dynamics exactly using LPT, while letting the N-body code solve for the small scales, without requiring it to capture exactly the internal dynamics of halos. Achieving a similar level of accuracy in halo statistics without the COLA method requires at least 3 times more timesteps than when COLA is employed. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian distributed, we show that the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realizations of the data, their statistical properties are described by the Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a figure of merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realizations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5 per cent error on a parameter error and N\textsubscript{D} ≪ 10\textsuperscript{2} data points, a minimum of 200 realizations of the survey are needed, with 10 per cent accuracy in the data covariance. If the number of data points N\textsubscript{D} ≫ 10\textsuperscript{2}, we need N\textsubscript{S} \&gt; N\textsubscript{D} realizations and a fractional accuracy of \&lt;√\{2/N\_D\} in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to N\textsubscript{D} \&gt; 10\textsuperscript{4}-10\textsuperscript{6}, this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling, shrinkage methods, data compression, simulation and data resampling methods.},

(1) It is unbeatable in the sense that no other method can measure Cl with smaller error bars. (2) It is quadratic, which makes the statistical properties of the measurements easy to compute and use for estimation of cosmological parameters. (3) It is computationally faster than rival high-precision methods such as the nonlinear maximum-likelihood technique, with the crucial steps scaling as n2 rather than n3, where n is the number of map pixels. (4) It is applicable to any survey geometry whatsoever, with arbitrary regions masked out and arbitrary noise behavior. (5) It is not a “black-box” method, but quite simple to understand intuitively: it corresponds to a high-pass filtering and edge softening of the original map followed by a straight expansion in truncated spherical harmonics. It is argued that this method is computationally feasible even for future high-resolution CMB experiments with n∼106–107. It is shown that Cl computed with this method is useful not merely for graphical presentation purposes, but also as an intermediate (and arguably necessary) step in the data analysis pipeline, reducing the data set to a more manageable size before the final step of constraining Gaussian cosmological models and parameters — while retaining all the cosmological information that was present in the original map.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial density field have the power to considerably improve our understanding of the physics of inflation. Indeed, if we can increase the precision of current measurements by an order of magnitude, a null-detection would rule out many classes of scenarios for generating primordial fluctuations. Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys represent experiments that hold the promise to realise this goal. Thus, we model the galaxy bispectrum and forecast the accuracy with which it will probe the parameter fNL, which represents the degree of primordial local-type non Gaussianity. Specifically, we address the problem of modelling redshift space distortions (RSD) in the tree-level galaxy bispectrum including fNL. We find novel contributions associated with RSD, with the characteristic large scale amplification induced by local-type non-Gaussianity. These RSD effects must be properly accounted for in order to obtain un-biased measurements of fNL from the galaxy bispectrum. We propose an analytic template for the monopole which can be used to fit against data on large scales, extending models used in the recent measurements. Finally, we perform idealised forecasts on σfNL—the accuracy of the determination of local non-linear parameter fNL—from measurements of the galaxy bispectrum. Our findings suggest that current surveys can in principle provide fNL constraints competitive with Planck, and future surveys could improve them further.},

The galaxy power spectrum already provides constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity complementary those from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), while the bispectrum contains additional shape information and has the potential to outperform CMB constraints in future. We develop the bias model for the halo density contrast in the presence of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, deriving a bivariate expansion up to second order in terms of the local linear matter density contrast and the local gravitational potential in Lagrangian coordinates. Nonlinear evolution of the matter density introduces a non-local tidal term in the halo model. Furthermore, the presence of local-type non-Gaussianity in the Lagrangian frame leads to a novel non-local convective term in the Eulerian frame, that is proportional to the displacement field when going beyond the spherical collapse approximation. We use an extended Press-Schechter approach to evaluate the halo mass function and thus the halo bispectrum. We show that including these non-local terms in the halo bispectra can lead to corrections of up to 25\% for some configurations, on large scales or at high redshift.},

  abstract = {We present angular diameter distance measurements obtained by locating the BAO scale in the distribution of galaxies selected from the first year of Dark Energy Survey data. We consider a sample of over 1.3 million galaxies distributed over a footprint of 1318 deg\$\^2\$ with \$0.6 {$<$} z\_\{\textbackslash rm photo\} {$<$} 1\$ and a typical redshift uncertainty of \$0.03(1+z)\$. This sample was selected, as fully described in a companion paper, using a color/magnitude selection that optimizes trade-offs between number density and redshift uncertainty. We investigate the BAO signal in the projected clustering using three conventions, the angular separation, the co-moving transverse separation, and spherical harmonics. Further, we compare results obtained from template based and machine learning photometric redshift determinations. We use 1800 simulations that approximate our sample in order to produce covariance matrices and allow us to validate our distance scale measurement methodology. We measure the angular diameter distance, \$D\_A\$, at the effective redshift of our sample divided by the true physical scale of the BAO feature, \$r\_\{\textbackslash rm d\}\$. We obtain close to a 4 per cent distance measurement of \$D\_A(z\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=0.81)/r\_\{\textbackslash rm d\} = 10.75\textbackslash pm 0.43 \$. These results are consistent with the flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM concordance cosmological model supported by numerous other recent experimental results.

  abstract = {On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per \$8.0\textbackslash times10\^4\$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, with the total mass of the system \$2.74\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.01\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg\$\^2\$ (90\% probability) and had a luminosity distance of \$40\^\{+8\}\_\{-14\}\$ Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.},

  abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of \$1.0 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-21\}\$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 \{\textbackslash sigma\}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of \$410\^\{+160\}\_\{-180\}\$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift \$z = 0.09\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\}\$. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are \$36\^\{+5\}\_\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$29\^\{+4\}\_\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$, and the final black hole mass is \$62\^\{+4\}\_\{-4\} M\_\textbackslash odot\$, with \$3.0\^\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.5\} M\_\textbackslash odot c\^2\$ radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract = {The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole merger source at redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, \$85\^\{+21\}\_\{-14\}\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$66\^\{+17\}\_\{-18\}\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, compared to previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital precession. The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range \$65 - 120\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. The probability that at least one of the black holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0\%. The final mass of the merger \$(142\^\{+28\}\_\{-16\}\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\})\$ classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular binary black hole coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties. Tests of strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical predictions. We estimate the merger rate of similar systems to be \$0.13\^\{+0.30\}\_\{-0.11\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Gpc\}\^\{-3\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$. We discuss the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse, and for the possible formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through various channels: via (multiple) stellar coalescence, or via hierarchical merger of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible sources for GW190521, including a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial black hole binary.},

This Science Requirements Document (SRD) quantifies the expected dark energy constraining power of these probes individually and together, with conservative assumptions about analysis methodology and follow-up observational resources based on our current understanding and the expected evolution within the field in the coming years. We then define requirements on analysis pipelines that will enable us to achieve our goal of carrying out a dark energy analysis consistent with the Dark Energy Task Force definition of a Stage IV dark energy experiment. This is achieved through a forecasting process that incorporates the flowdown to detailed requirements on multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Future versions of this document will include evolution in our software capabilities and analysis plans along with updates to the LSST survey strategy.},

  abstract = {We investigate the importance of several numerical artefacts such as lack of resolution on spectral properties of the Lyalpha forest as computed from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in a standard cold dark matter universe. We use a new simulation code which is based on a combination of a hierarchical particle-particle-particle-mesh (P3M) scheme for gravity and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for gas dynamics. We have performed extensive comparisons between this new code and a modified version of the HYDRA code of Couchman et al. and find excellent agreement. We have also rerun the TREESPH simulations of Hernquist et al. using our new codes and find very good agreement with their published results. This shows that results from hydrodynamical simulations that include cooling are reproducible with different numerical algorithms. We then use our new code to investigate several numerical effects, such as resolution, on spectral statistics deduced from Voigt profile fitting of lines by running simulations with gas particle masses of 1.4x10\^8, 1.8x10\^7, 2.2x10\^6 and 2.1x10\^5Msolar. When we increase the numerical resolution the mean effective hydrogen optical depth converges and so does the column density distribution. However, higher resolution simulations produce narrower lines and consequently the b parameter (velocity width) distribution has only marginally converged in our highest resolution run. Obtaining numerical convergence for the mean HeII transmission is demanding. When progressively smaller haloes are resolved at better resolution, a larger fraction of low-density gas contracts to moderate overdensities in which Heii is already optically thick, and this increases the net transmission, making it difficult to simulate Heii reliably. Our highest resolution simulation gives a mean effective optical depth in Heii 5 per cent lower than the simulation with eight times lower mass resolution, illustrating the degree to which the Heii optical depth has converged. In contrast, the hydrogen mean optical depth for these runs is identical. As many properties of the simulated Lyalpha forest depend on resolution, one should be careful when deducing physical parameters from a comparison of the simulated forest with the observed one. We compare predictions from our highest resolution simulation in a cold dark matter universe, with a photoionizing background inferred from quasars as computed by Haardt \& Madau, with observations. The simulation reproduces both the HI column density and b parameter distribution when we assume a high baryon density, Omega\_Bh\^2{$>\sptilde$}0.028. In addition we need to impose a higher intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature than predicted within our basic set of assumptions. We argue that such a higher temperature could be caused by differences between the assumed and true reionization history. The simulated HI optical depth is in good agreement with observations, but the Heii optical depth is lower than observed. Fitting the Heii optical depth requires a larger jump, \textasciitilde 14, between the photon flux at the HI and Heii edge than is present in the Haardt \& Madau spectrum.},

  abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic analysis of 492 450 galaxy spectra from the  first two years of observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III/Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. This data set has been released in the ninth SDSS data release, the first public data release of BOSS spectra. We show that the typical signal-to-noise ratio of BOSS spectra, despite being low, is sufficient to measure stellar velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes for individual objects. We show that the typical velocity dispersion of a BOSS galaxy is ˜240 km s-1. The typical error in the velocity dispersion measurement is 14 per cent, and 93 per cent of BOSS galaxies have velocity dispersions with an accuracy of better than 30 per cent. The distribution in velocity dispersion is redshift independent between redshifts 0.15 and 0.7, which reflects the survey design targeting massive galaxies with an approximately uniform mass distribution in this redshift interval. We show that emission lines can be measured on BOSS spectra. However, the majority of BOSS galaxies lack detectable emission lines, as is to be expected because of the target selection design towards massive galaxies. We analyse the emission line properties and present diagnostic diagrams using the emission lines [O II], Hβ, [O III], H$\alpha$ and [N II] (detected in about 4 per cent of the galaxies) to separate star-forming objects and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We show that the emission line properties are strongly redshift dependent and that there is a clear correlation between observed frame colours and emission line properties. Within in the low-z sample (LOWZ) around 0.15 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.3, half of the emission line galaxies have low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)-like emission line ratios, followed by Seyfert-AGN-dominated spectra, and only a small fraction of a few per cent are purely star-forming galaxies. AGN and LINER-like objects, instead, are less prevalent in the high-z sample (CMASS) around 0.4 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.7, where more than half of the emission line objects are star forming. This is a pure selection effect caused by the non-detection of weak Hβ emission lines in the BOSS spectra. Finally, we show that star-forming, AGN and emission line free galaxies are well separated in the g - r versus r - i target selection diagram.},

  abstract = {Using the Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) Mass Association Scheme, we make theoretical predictions for the three-dimensional three-point correlation function (3PCF) of the Ly$\alpha$ forest at redshift z = 2.3. We bootstrap results from the (100 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc)\textsuperscript{3} Horizon hydrodynamic simulation to a (1 h\textsuperscript{-1} Gpc)\textsuperscript{3}N-body simulation, considering both a uniform ultraviolet background (UVB) and a fluctuating UVB sourced by quasars with a comoving n\textsubscript{q} ≈ 10\textsuperscript{-5}h\textsuperscript{3} Mpc\textsuperscript{-3} placed either in massive haloes or randomly. On scales of 10-30 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, the flux 3PCF displays hierarchical scaling with the square of the two-point correlation function (2PCF), but with an unusual value of Q ≡ ζ\textsubscript{123}/(ξ\textsubscript{12}ξ\textsubscript{13} + ξ\textsubscript{12}ξ\textsubscript{23} + ξ\textsubscript{13}ξ\textsubscript{23}) ≈ -4.5 that reflects the low bias of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and the anticorrelation between mass density and transmitted flux. For halo-based quasars and an ionizing photon mean free path of λ = 300 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc comoving, UVB fluctuations moderately depress the 2PCF and 3PCF, with cancelling effects on Q. For λ = 100 or 50 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, UVB fluctuations substantially boost the 2PCF and 3PCF on large scales, shifting the hierarchical ratio to Q ≈ -3. We scale our simulation results to derive rough estimate of the detectability of the 3PCF in current and future observational data sets for the redshift range z = 2.1-2.6. At r = 10 and 20 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, we predict a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ̃9 and ̃7, respectively, for both Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and extended BOSS (eBOSS), and ̃37 and ̃25 for Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). At r = 40 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc the predicted SNR is lower by a factor of ̃3-5. Measuring the flux 3PCF would provide a novel test of the conventional paradigm of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and help separate the contributions of UVB fluctuations and density fluctuations to Ly$\alpha$ forest clustering, thereby solidifying its foundation as a tool of precision cosmology.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive catalog of ultraviolet (HST/STIS and FUSE)  absorbers in the low-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) at z {$<$} 0.4. The catalog draws from much of the extensive literature on IGM absorption and reconciles discrepancies among several previous catalogs through a critical evaluation of all reported absorption features in light of new HST/COS data. We report on 746 H I absorbers down to a rest-frame equivalent width of 12 mÅ over a maximum redshift path length Δz = 5.38. We also confirm 111 O VI absorbers, 29 C IV absorbers, and numerous absorption lines due to other metal ions. We characterize the bivariate distribution of absorbers in redshift and column density as a power law, \textbackslash left(\textbackslash partial \^2 \{N\}/\textbackslash partial z\textbackslash partial N\textbackslash right) \textbackslash propto N\^\{-\textbackslash beta \}, where β = 2.08 ± 0.12 for O VI and β = 1.68 ± 0.03 for H I. Utilizing a more sophisticated accounting technique than past work, our catalog accounts for \textasciitilde 43\% of the baryons: 24\% ± 2\% in the photoionized Ly$\alpha$ forest and 19\% ± 2\% in the warm-hot IGM as traced by O VI. We discuss the large systematic effects of various assumed metallicities and ionization states on these calculations, and we implement recent simulation results in our estimates. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

  abstract = {Using observations in the COSMOS field, we report an intriguing correlation between the star formation activity of massive (\textasciitilde 10\^\{11.4\}\textbackslash msol) central galaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (\textasciitilde 10 Mpc) environments of their group-mass (\textasciitilde 10\^\{13.6\}\textbackslash msol) dark matter halos. Probing the redshift range z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an X-ray detected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation derived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. At z=1, we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two less than in passive centrals at the same halo mass. This implies that the presence or lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochastic process. By z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the different growth rates of these objects. A similar but weaker trend is observed when dividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. Remarkably, we find that star-forming centrals at z\textasciitilde 1 live in groups that are significantly more clustered on 10 Mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passive centrals. We discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recent simulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higher angular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halos are known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. If confirmed, this would be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history of halos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that form inside them.},

For massive galaxies, M * {$>\sptilde$} 1010.6 M ⊙, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * \textasciitilde{} 1010 M ⊙, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

Halos are identified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the mass around isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is Δ times the background. We calibrate fitting functions for the large-scale bias that are adaptable to any value of Δ we examine. We find a \textasciitilde 6\% scatter about our best-fit bias relation. Our fitting functions couple to the halo mass functions of Tinker et al. such that the bias of all dark matter is normalized to unity. We demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos is higher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of Sheth et al. and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapse model for the rarest halos. Halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halos identified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos with the canonical Δ = 200 overdensity by \textasciitilde 10\%. In contrast to our previous results on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolves very weakly with redshift, if at all. We use our numerical results, both for the mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background split model for halo bias. We find that the peak-background split achieves a reasonable agreement with the numerical results, but \textasciitilde 20\% residuals remain, both at high and low masses.},

The large-scale linear bias of a population of dynamically passive galaxies, which we select from both surveys, is easily modelled. Knowing the bias evolution breaks degeneracies inherent to other methodologies, and decreases the uncertainty in measurements of the rate of structure growth and the normalization of the galaxy power spectrum by up to a factor of 2. If we translate our measurements into a constraint on σ\textsubscript{8}(z = 0) assuming a concordance cosmological model and general relativity (GR), we find that using a bias model improves our uncertainty by a factor of nearly 1.5. Our results are consistent with a flat Λ cold dark matter model and with GR.},

This is attributed to the isochrones underestimating the I-band bolometric corrections in very cool luminous stars of solar metallicity. A value of the Hubble constant of 82 + or - 7 km/s Mpc is derived, and it is pointed out that the agreement between this value and that given in a previous study reflects the fact that the M31 calibration of fluctuation absolute luminosity yields results identical to IRTF calibrations.},

We find that the covariance of the power spectrum from the new fast realizations is more accurate than that from a lognormal model. As a proof of concept, we also apply the new simulation scheme to the divergence of the Lagrangian displacement field. We find that information from the correlation function and the PDF of the displacement-divergence provides modest improvement over other standard analytical techniques to describe the particle field in the simulation. This suggests that further progress in this direction should come from multi-scale or non-local properties of the initial matter distribution.},

The model continuum was selected as the best-fit match from a set of template quasar spectra binned in luminosity, emission line width, and redshift, with the power-law spectral index and amount of dust reddening as additional free parameters. We characterize our sample through the traditional ``balnicity'' index and a revised absorption index, as well as through parameters such as the width, outflow velocity, fractional depth, and number of troughs. From a sample of 16,883 quasars at 1.7{$<$}=z{$<$}=4.38, we identify 4386 (26.0\%) quasars with broad C IV absorption, of which 1756 (10.4\%) satisfy traditional selection criteria.

Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution.

By including pair counts measured from random catalogues of velocities and positions sampled from distributions characteristic of the true data, we find that the variance in the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function is significantly reduced. Applying a covariance analysis and \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ minimisation procedure to these statistics, we determine estimates and errors for the normalised growth rate \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ and the parameter \$\textbackslash beta = f/b\$, where \$b\$ is the galaxy bias factor. We test this framework on mock hemisphere datasets for redshift \$z {$<$} 0.1\$ with realistic velocity noise constructed from the L-PICOLA simulation code, and find that we are able to recover the fiducial value of \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ from the joint combination of \$\textbackslash psi\_1\$ + \$\textbackslash psi\_2\$ + \$\textbackslash psi\_3\$ + \$\textbackslash xi\_\{gg\}\$, with 15\textbackslash\% accuracy from individual mocks.

  abstract = {Galaxy peculiar velocities provide an integral source of cosmological information that can be harnessed to measure the growth rate of large scale structure and constrain possible extensions to General Relativity. In this work, we present a method for extracting the information contained within galaxy peculiar velocities through an ensemble of direct peculiar velocity and galaxy clustering correlation statistics, including the effects of redshift space distortions, using data from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey. Our method compares the auto- and cross-correlation function multipoles of these observables with respect to the local line-of-sight, with the predictions of cosmological models. We find that the uncertainty in our measurement is improved when combining these two sources of information when compared to fitting to either peculiar velocity or clustering information separately. When combining velocity and density statistics in the range \$27 {$<$} s {$<$} 123 \textbackslash,\$h\$\^\{-1\}\$Mpc we obtain a value for the local growth rate of \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.357 \textbackslash pm 0.071\$ and for the linear redshift distortion parameter \$\textbackslash beta = 0.297 \textbackslash pm 0.061\$, recovering both with approximately 20 per cent accuracy. We conclude this work by comparing our measurement with other recent local measurements of the growth rate, spanning different datasets and methodologies. We find that our results are in broad agreement with those in the literature and are fully consistent with \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology. Our methods can be readily scaled to analyse upcoming large galaxy surveys and achieve accurate tests of the cosmological model.},

We employ the pixel optical depth method and uncover strong correlations between various combinations of H I, C III, C IV, Si III, Si IV, and O VI. We find good agreement between many of the simulated and observed correlations, including τ\_\{O VI\}(τ\_\{H I\}). However, the observed median optical depths for the τ\_\{C IV\}\vphantom\{\}(τ\_\{H I\}) and τ\_\{Si IV\}(τ\_\{H I\}) relations are higher than those measured from the mock spectra. The discrepancy increases from up to ≈0.1 dex at τ\_\{H I\}=1 to ≈1 dex at τ\_\{H I\}=10\^2, where we are likely probing dense regions at small galactocentric distances. As possible solutions, we invoke (a) models of ionizing radiation softened above 4 Ryd to account for delayed completion of He II reionization; (b) simulations run at higher resolution; (c) the inclusion of additional line broadening due to unresolved turbulence; and (d) increased elemental abundances; however, none of these factors can fully explain the observed differences. Enhanced photoionization of H I by local sources, which was not modelled, could offer a solution. However, the much better agreement with the observed O VI(H I) relation, which we find probes a hot and likely collisionally ionized gas phase, indicates that the simulations are not in tension with the hot phase of the IGM, and suggests that the simulated outflows may entrain insufficient cool gas.},

However, the interstellar medium of the Milky Way introduces absorption lines into the spectrum of any extragalactic source. These lines, while weak and undetectable in a single BOSS spectrum, could potentially bias the cosmological signal. In order to examine this, we generate absorption line maps by stacking over a million spectra of galaxies and QSOs. We find that the systematics introduced are too small to affect the current accuracy of the baryon acoustic peak, but might be relevant to future surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We outline a method to account for this with future data sets.},

  abstract = {The problem of the reconstruction of the large scale density and velocity fields from peculiar velocities surveys is addressed here within a Bayesian framework by means of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. The HAmiltonian Monte carlo reconstruction of the Local EnvironmenT (Hamlet) algorithm is designed to reconstruct the linear large scale density and velocity fields in conjunction with the undoing of lognormal bias in the derived distances and velocities of peculiar velocities surveys such as the Cosmicflows data. The Hamlet code has been tested against Cosmicflows mock catalogs consisting of up to 30 000 data points with mock errors akin to those of the Cosmicflows-3 data, within the framework of the LCDM standard model of cosmology. The Hamlet code outperforms previous applications of Gibbs sampling MCMC reconstruction from the Cosmicflows-3 data by two to four orders of magnitude in CPU time. The gain in performance is due to the inherent higher efficiency of the HMC algorithm and due to parallel computing on GPUs rather than CPUs. This gain will enable an increase in the reconstruction of the large scale structure from the upcoming Cosmicfows-4 data and the setting of constrained initial conditions for cosmological high resolution simulations.},

  abstract = {We expect a detectable correlation between two seemingly unrelated  quantities: the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the amplitude of flux decrements in quasar (QSO) spectra. The amplitude of CMB convergence in a given direction measures the projected surface density of matter. Measurements of QSO flux decrements trace the small-scale distribution of gas along a given line of sight. While the cross-correlation between these two measurements is small for a single line of sight, upcoming large surveys should enable its detection. This paper presents analytical estimates for the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for measurements of the cross-correlation between the flux decrement and the convergence, \textbackslash langle \textbackslash delta \{F\}\textbackslash kappa \textbackslash rangle, and for measurements of the cross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence, \textbackslash langle (\textbackslash delta \{F\})\^2 \textbackslash kappa \textbackslash rangle. For the ongoing BOSS (SDSS-III) and Planck surveys, we estimate an S/N of 30 and 9.6 for these two correlations. For the proposed BigBOSS and ACTPOL surveys, we estimate an S/N of 130 and 50, respectively. Since \textbackslash langle (\textbackslash delta \{F\})\^2 \textbackslash kappa \textbackslash rangle \textbackslash propto \textbackslash sigma \_8\^4, the amplitude of these cross-correlations can potentially be used to measure the amplitude of σ8 at z \textasciitilde{} 2\%-2.5\% with BOSS and Planck and even better with future data sets. These measurements have the potential to test alternative theories for dark energy and to constrain the mass of the neutrino. The large potential signal estimated in our analytical calculations motivates tests with nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations and analyses of upcoming data sets.},

The detection of this effect would be a direct measure of the neutral hydrogen-matter cross correlation and could provide important information on the growth of structures at large scales in a redshift range which is still poorly probed.},

  abstract = {We have created a variety of composite quasar spectra using a homogeneous data set of over 2200 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The quasar sample spans a redshift range of 0.044{$<$}=z{$<$}=4.789 and an absolute r' magnitude range of -18.0 to -26.5. The input spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3800-9200 Å at a resolution of 1800. The median composite covers a rest-wavelength range from 800 to 8555 Å and reaches a peak signal-to-noise ratio of over 300 per 1 Å resolution element in the rest frame. We have identified over 80 emission-line features in the spectrum. Emission-line shifts relative to nominal laboratory wavelengths are seen for many of the ionic species. Peak shifts of the broad permitted and semiforbidden lines are strongly correlated with ionization energy, as previously suggested, but we find that the narrow forbidden lines are also shifted by amounts that are strongly correlated with ionization energy. The magnitude of the forbidden line shifts is {$<\sptilde$}100 km s-1, compared with shifts of up to 550 km s-1 for some of the permitted and semiforbidden lines. At wavelengths longer than the Ly$\alpha$ emission, the continuum of the geometric mean composite is well fitted by two power laws, with a break at \textasciitilde 5000 Å. The frequency power-law index, $\alpha$ν, is -0.44 from \textasciitilde 1300 to 5000 Å and -2.45 redward of \textasciitilde 5000 Å. The abrupt change in slope can be accounted for partly by host-galaxy contamination at low redshift. Stellar absorption lines, including higher order Balmer lines, seen in the composites suggest that young or intermediate-age stars make a significant contribution to the light of the host galaxies. Most of the spectrum is populated by blended emission lines, especially in the range 1500-3500 Å, which can make the estimation of quasar continua highly uncertain unless large ranges in wavelength are observed. An electronic table of the median quasar template is available.

  abstract = {We report the detection of a significant (5.5 sigma ) excess of  correlations between galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes. This detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure was made using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin2 obtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) with the UH8K and CFH12K panoramic CCD cameras. The amplitude of the excess correlation is 2.2+/- 0.2\% at 1 arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lensing effect induced by large-scale structure. We provide a quantitative analysis of systematics which could contribute to the signal and show that the net effect is small and can be corrected for. In particular, we show that the spurious excess of correlations caused by the residual of the anisotropic Point Spread Function (PSF) correction is well below the measured signal. We show that the measured ellipticity correlations behave as expected for a gravitational shear signal. The relatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints on cosmological models. However the data are in favor of cluster normalized cosmological models, and marginally reject Cold Dark Matter models with (Omega =0.3, sigma\_8 {$<$}0.6) or (Omega =1, sigma\_8 =1). The detection of cosmic shear demonstrates the technical feasibility of using weak lensing surveys to measure dark matter clustering and the potential for cosmological parameter measurements, in particular with upcoming wide field CCD cameras.

  abstract = {We investigate the potential sources of theoretical systematics in the anisotropic Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance scale measurements from the clustering of galaxies in configuration space using the final Data Release (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We perform a detailed study of the impact on BAO measurements from choices in the methodology such as fiducial cosmology, clustering estimators, random catalogues, fitting templates, and covariance matrices. The theoretical systematic uncertainties in BAO parameters are found to be 0.002 in the isotropic dilation $\alpha$ and 0.003 in the quadrupolar dilation ∊. The leading source of systematic uncertainty is related to the reconstruction techniques. Theoretical uncertainties are sub-dominant compared with the statistical uncertainties for BOSS survey, accounting 0.2σ\textsubscript{stat} for $\alpha$ and 0.25σ\textsubscript{stat} for ∊ (σ\textsubscript{$\alpha$, stat} ̃ 0.010 and σ\textsubscript{∊, stat} ̃ 0.012, respectively). We also present BAO-only distance scale constraints from the anisotropic analysis of the correlation function. Our constraints on the angular diameter distance D\textsubscript{A}(z) and the Hubble parameter H(z), including both statistical and theoretical systematic uncertainties, are 1.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent at z\textsubscript{eff} = 0.38, 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent at z\textsubscript{eff} = 0.51, and 1.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent at z\textsubscript{eff} = 0.61. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering data set from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are cross-checked with other BAO analysis in Alam et al. The systematic error budget concerning the methodology on post-reconstruction BAO analysis presented here is used in Alam et al. to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction algorithm introduced by Eisenstein et al., which is  widely used in clustering analysis, is based on the inference of the first-order Lagrangian displacement field from the Gaussian smoothed galaxy density field in redshift space. The smoothing scale applied to the density field affects the inferred displacement field that is used to move the galaxies, and partially erases the non-linear evolution of the density field. In this article, we explore this crucial step in the reconstruction algorithm. We study the performance of the reconstruction technique using two metrics: first, we study the performance using the anisotropic clustering, extending previous studies focused on isotropic clustering; secondly, we study its effect on the displacement field. We find that smoothing has a strong effect in the quadrupole of the correlation function and affects the accuracy and precision with which we can measure DA(z) and H(z). We find that the optimal smoothing scale to use in the reconstruction algorithm applied to Baryonic Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey-Constant (stellar) MASS (CMASS) is between 5 and 10 h-1 Mpc. Varying from the `usual' 15-5 h-1 Mpc shows ˜0.3 per cent variations in DA(z) and ˜0.4 per cent H(z) and uncertainties are also reduced by 40 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. We also find that the accuracy of velocity field reconstruction depends strongly on the smoothing scale used for the density field. We measure the bias and uncertainties associated with different choices of smoothing length.},

  abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between pair counts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR, and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT, and N-body), we obtain a 20-25\% gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and ΛCDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15\% improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter Ωm and dark energy ΩΛ in an open ΛCDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

We use a semianalytic model to study the scientific yield of combining SZE data with X-ray and optical follow-up observations. If clusters at a given redshift z0 can be identified with virialized, spherical halos, they populate a well-defined fundamental plane (FP) in the parameter space of the three observables virial temperature (T), total Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux decrement (ΔSν), and angular size (θ). The location and orientation of the FP, as well as its redshift evolution, are sensitive to both the internal evolution of clusters and to the underlying cosmological parameters. We show that if clusters are not standard candles (e.g., because of feedback or energy injection), then this can be inferred from the FP. Likewise, we study the dependence of the FP on the cosmological parameters h, σ8, and Ω0, and quantify future constraints on these parameters. We also show that in the absence of any nongravitational effects, the scatter in the (ΔSν,T)-plane is significantly smaller than in either the (θ,T) or the (θ,ΔSν) planes. As a result, the ΔSν-T relation can be an exceptionally sensitive probe of both cluster physics and cosmological parameters. A comparison of the amount of scatter in these three scaling relations will test the origin (cosmological vs. stochastic) of the scatter.},

We bin these individual low signal-to-noise measurements to obtain the mean emission properties of the QSO population as a function of redshift. The emission is dominated by dust at all redshifts, with a peak at z 2, the same location as the peak in the general cosmic star formation rate. Restricting analysis to radio-loud QSOs, we find synchrotron emission with a monochromatic luminosity at 100 GHz (rest-frame) rising from overline\{L\_synch=0\} to 0.2 L\textsubscript{☉} Hz\textsuperscript{-1} between z = 0 and 3. The radio-quiet subsample does not show any synchrotron emission, but we detect thermal SZ between z = 2.5 and 4; no significant SZ emission is seen at lower redshifts.

  abstract = {The flux power spectrum of the Lyman $\alpha$ forest in quasar  [quasi-stellar object (QSO)] absorption spectra is sensitive to a wide range of cosmological and astrophysical parameters and instrumental effects. Modelling the flux power spectrum in this large parameter space to an accuracy comparable to the statistical uncertainty of large samples of QSO spectra is very challenging. We use here a coarse grid of hydrodynamical simulations run with GADGET-2 to obtain a `best-guess' model around which we calculate a finer grid of flux power spectra using a Taylor expansion of the flux power spectrum to first order. In this way, we investigate how the interplay between astrophysical and cosmological parameters affects their measurements using the recently published flux power spectrum obtained from 3035 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QSOs. We find that the SDSS flux power spectrum alone is able to constrain a wide range of parameters including the amplitude of the matter power spectrum σ8, the matter density Ωm, the spectral index of primordial density fluctuations n, the effective optical depth τeff and its evolution. The thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is, however, poorly constrained and the SDSS data favour either an unplausibly large temperature or an unplausibly steep temperature-density relation. By enforcing a thermal history of the IGM consistent with that inferred from high-resolution QSO spectra, we find the following values for the best-fitting model (assuming a flat universe with a cosmological constant and zero neutrino mass): Ωm= 0.28 +/- 0.03, n= 0.95 +/- 0.04 and σ8= 0.91 +/- 0.07 (1σ error bars). The values for σ8 and n are consistent with those obtained by McDonald et al. with different simulations for similar assumptions. We argue, however, that the major uncertainties in this measurement are still systematic rather than statistical.},

The free-streaming of neutrinos results in a (non-linear) scale-dependent suppression of power spectrum of the total matter distribution at scales probed by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data which is larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25 \% and strongly redshift dependent. By extracting a set of realistic mock quasar spectra, we quantify the effect of neutrinos on the flux probability distribution function and flux power spectrum. The differences in the matter power spectra translate into a \textasciitilde{} 2.5\% (5\%) difference in the flux power spectrum for neutrino masses with Σmν = 0.3 eV (0.6 eV). This rather small effect is difficult to detect from present Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data and nearly perfectly degenerate with the overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum as characterised by σ8. If the results of the numerical simulations are normalized to have the same σ8 in the initial conditions, then neutrinos produce a smaller suppression in the flux power of about 3\% (5\%) for Σmν = 0.6 eV (1.2 eV) when compared to a simulation without neutrinos. We present constraints on neutrino masses using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey flux power spectrum alone and find an upper limit of Σmν {$<$} 0.9 eV (2σ C.L.), comparable to constraints obtained from the cosmic microwave background data or other large scale structure probes.},

We find that the void distribution in the flux is in excellent agreement with predictions of the standard Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, which also fits other flux statistics remarkably well. We then model the relation between flux voids and the corresponding 1D gas-density field along the line of sight and make a preliminary attempt to connect the 1D properties of the gas-density field to the 3D dark matter distribution at the same redshift. This provides a framework that allows statistical interpretations of the void population at high redshift using observed quasar spectra, and eventually it will enable linking the void properties of the high-redshift universe with those at lower redshifts, which are better known.},

Our reanalysis of the Croft et al. data agrees well with their results if we assume the same mean optical depth and gas temperature-density relation. The inferred linear dark matter power spectrum at z= 2.72 also agrees with that inferred from LUQAS at lower redshift if we assume that the increase of the amplitude is due to gravitational growth between these redshifts. We further argue that the smaller mean optical depth measured from high-resolution spectra is more accurate than the larger value obtained from low-resolution spectra by Press et al. which Croft et al. used. For the smaller optical depth we obtain a \textasciitilde 20 per cent higher value for the rms fluctuation amplitude of the matter density. By combining the amplitude of the matter power spectrum inferred from the Ly$\alpha$ forest with the amplitude on large scales inferred from measurements of the CMB we obtain constraints on the primordial spectral index n and the normalization σ8. For values of the mean optical depth favoured by high-resolution spectra, the inferred linear power spectrum is consistent with a ΛCDM model with a scale-free (n= 1) primordial power spectrum.},

In all clusters, gas-temperature profiles are measured to large radii (Vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are possible to nearly r500 or beyond. The gas density was accurately traced to larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta model, showing continuous steepening with radius. The derived ρtot profiles and their scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with concentration expected for dark matter halos in ΛCDM cosmology. However, in three cool clusters, we detect a central mass component in excess of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, apparently associated with their cD galaxies. In the inner region (r{$<$}0.1r500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the mass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement with the simple self-similar behavior, M500\textasciitilde T$\alpha$, where $\alpha$=(1.5-1.6)+/-0.1, if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The normalization of this M-T relation is significantly, by \textasciitilde 30\%, higher than most previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction profiles, which show an increase with both radius and cluster mass. The enclosed fgas profiles within r2500\textasciitilde =0.4r500 have not yet reached any asymptotic value and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the universal baryon fraction according to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations.

While on large scales the clustering of matter and CDM+baryons is very different in cosmologies with massive and massless neutrinos, we find that the effect neutrinos have on the clustering of CDM+baryons in redshift space on small scales is almost entirely due to the change in σ 8. We show that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on all scales, from the effects induced by varying σ 8. We find that the effects of neutrinos on the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from ∼0.3\% to 2\% on scales k\textbackslash in [0.01,0.5] h \{Mpc\}\vphantom\{\}-1 for neutrinos with masses \{M\}ν ≤slant 0.15 \{eV\}. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the momentum of CDM+baryons and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with massless and massive neutrinos considered. We show that, even on very large scales, nonlinear corrections are important to describe the clustering of halos in redshift space in cosmologies with massless and massive neutrinos at low redshift. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons, and halos in redshift space by less than 1\%. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully nonlinear regime can be written as a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics that can be studied through N-body simulations.},

  abstract = {Current and upcoming radio telescopes will map the spatial distribution of cosmic neutral hydrogen (H I) through its 21 cm emission. In order to extract the maximum information from these surveys, accurate theoretical predictions are needed. We study the abundance and clustering properties of H I at redshifts z ≤ 5 using TNG100, a large state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 75 h \textsuperscript{−1} Mpc box size, which is part of the IllustrisTNG Project. We show that most of the H I lies within dark matter halos, and we provide fits for the halo H I mass function, i.e., the mean H I mass hosted by a halo of mass M at redshift z. We find that only halos with circular velocities larger than ≃30 km s\textsuperscript{−1} contain H I. While the density profiles of H I exhibit a large halo-to-halo scatter, the mean profiles are universal across mass and redshift. The H I in low-mass halos is mostly located in the central galaxy, while in massive halos the H I is concentrated in the satellites. Our simulation reproduces the bias value of damped Ly$\alpha$ systems from observations. We show that the H I and matter density probability distribution functions differ significantly. Our results point out that for small halos, the H I bulk velocity goes in the same direction and has the same magnitude as the halo peculiar velocity, while in large halos, differences show up. We find that halo H I velocity dispersion follows a power law with halo mass. We find a complicated H I bias, with H I already becoming nonlinear at k = 0.3 h Mpc\textsuperscript{−1} at z ≳ 3. The clustering of H I can, however, be accurately reproduced by perturbative methods. We find a new secondary bias by showing that the clustering of halos depends not only on mass but also on H I content. We compute the amplitude of the H I shot noise and find that it is small at all redshifts, verifying the robustness of BAO measurements with 21 cm intensity mapping. We study the clustering of H I in redshift space and show that linear theory can explain the ratio between the monopoles in redshift and real space down to 0.3, 0.5, and 1 h Mpc\textsuperscript{−1} at redshifts 3, 4, and 5, respectively. We find that the amplitude of the Fingers-of-God effect is larger for H I than for matter, since H I is found only in halos above a certain mass. We point out that 21 cm maps can be created from N-body simulations rather than full hydrodynamic simulations. Modeling the one-halo term is crucial for achieving percent accuracy with respect to a full hydrodynamic treatment. Although our results are not converged against resolution, they are, however, very useful as we work at the resolution where the model parameters have been calibrated to reproduce galaxy properties.},

  abstract = {We develop a perturbative approach to redshift space distortions (RSD)  using the phase space distribution function approach and apply it to the dark matter redshift space power spectrum and its moments. RSD can be written as a sum over density weighted velocity moments correlators, with the lowest order being density, momentum density and stress energy density. We use standard and extended perturbation theory (PT) to determine their auto and cross correlators, comparing them to N-body simulations. We show which of the terms can be modeled well with the standard PT and which need additional terms that include higher order corrections which cannot be modeled in PT. Most of these additional terms are related to the small scale velocity dispersion effects, the so called finger of god (FoG) effects, which affect some, but not all, of the terms in this expansion, and which can be approximately modeled using a simple physically motivated ansatz such as the halo model. We point out that there are several velocity dispersions that enter into the detailed RSD analysis with very different amplitudes, which can be approximately predicted by the halo model. In contrast to previous models our approach systematically includes all of the terms at a given order in PT and provides a physical interpretation for the small scale dispersion values. We investigate RSD power spectrum as a function of μ, the cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode and line of sight, focusing on the lowest order powers of μ and multipole moments which dominate the observable RSD power spectrum. Overall we find considerable success in modeling many, but not all, of the terms in this expansion. This is similar to the situation in real space, but predicting power spectrum in redshift space is more difficult because of the explicit influence of small scale dispersion type effects in RSD, which extend to very large scales.},

  abstract = {Within the Halo Model of large scale structure, all matter is contained in dark matter halos. This simple yet powerful framework has been broadly applied to multiple data sets and enriched our comprehension of how matter is distributed in the Universe. In this work we extend this assumption by allowing for matter to rest not only inside halos but also within cosmic voids and in between halos and voids (which we call `dust'). This assumption leads to additional contributions (1Void, 2Void, Halo-Void, etc.) to the predictions of correlation functions, spectra and profiles for both halos and voids. Whereas the Halo Model can only make predictions for halo quantities, the Halo Void Model extends those for void statistics and halo-void cross-correlations. We provide recipes for all new ingredients of the Halo Void (Dust) Model, such as the void abundance, linear bias and density profile and test their validity in a N-body simulation. Including voids and dust into the calculations improves the transition between the 1Halo and the 2Halo terms by up to \textasciitilde{} 6\%. It also eliminates the need to include low-mass structures on the normalization of large-scale terms, suggesting that halos and voids are complementary cosmic structures to effectively describe matter distribution on large scales of the Universe.},

For the 22 clusters in common between the Planck cosmology sample and WtG, we find an overall mass ratio of \$\textbackslash left{$<$} M\_\{Planck\}/M\_\{\textbackslash rm WtG\} \textbackslash right{$>$} = 0.688 \textbackslash pm 0.072\$. Extending the sample to clusters not used in the Planck cosmology analysis yields a consistent value of \$\textbackslash left{$<$} M\_\{Planck\}/M\_\{\textbackslash rm WtG\} \textbackslash right{$>$} = 0.698 \textbackslash pm 0.062\$ from 38 clusters in common. Identifying the weak-lensing masses as proxies for the true cluster mass (on average), these ratios are \$\textbackslash sim 1.6\textbackslash sigma\$ lower than the default mass bias of 0.8 assumed in the Planck cluster analysis. Adopting the WtG weak-lensing-based mass calibration would substantially reduce the tension found between the Planck cluster count cosmology results and those from CMB temperature anisotropies. We also find modest evidence (at 95 per cent confidence) for a mass dependence of the calibration ratio and discuss its potential origin in light of systematic uncertainties in the temperature calibration of the X-ray measurements used to calibrate the Planck cluster masses. Our results exemplify the critical role that robust absolute mass calibration plays in cluster cosmology, and the invaluable role of accurate weak-lensing mass measurements in this regard.},

Using Hubble Space Telescope spectra of 24 active galactic nuclei, we sample the gas in this filament. All of our sightlines pass outside the virial radius of any known filament galaxy. Within 500 kpc of the filament axis the detection rate is ̃80\%, but no detections are seen more than 2.1 Mpc from the filament axis. The width of the Ly$\alpha$ lines correlates with filament impact parameter and the four BLAs in our sample occur within 400 kpc of the filament axis, indicating increased temperature and/or turbulence. Comparing to simulations, we find that the recent Haardt \&amp; Madau extragalactic ionizing background predicts a factor of 3-5 too few ionizing photons. Using a more intense radiation field matches the hydrogen density profile within 2.1 Mpc of the filament axis, but the simulations still overpredict the detection rate between 2.1 and 5 Mpc from the axis.

Our measurement results in unprecedented precision on the small-scale modes k\&gt; 0.02 \{\{s\}\} \{\{km\}\}\textsuperscript{-1}, inaccessible to previous SDSS/BOSS analyses. It is well known that these high-k modes are highly sensitive to the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, but contamination by narrow metal lines is a significant concern. We quantify the effect of metals on the small-scale power and find a modest effect on modes with k\&lt; 0.1 \{\{s\}\} \{\{km\}\}\textsuperscript{-1}. As a result, by masking metals and restricting to k\&lt; 0.1 \{\{s\}\} \{\{km\}\}\textsuperscript{-1}, their impact is completely mitigated. We present an end-to-end Bayesian forward-modeling framework whereby mock spectra with the same noise, resolution, and masking as our data are generated from Ly$\alpha$ forest simulations. These mock spectra are used to build a custom emulator, enabling us to interpolate between a sparse grid of models and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo fits. Our results agree well with BOSS on scales k\&lt; 0.02 \{\{s\}\} \{\{km\}\}\textsuperscript{-1}, where the measurements overlap. The combination of the percent-level low-k precision of BOSS with our 5\%-15\% high-k measurements results in a powerful new data set for precisely constraining the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, cosmological parameters, and the nature of dark matter.

After moving observed galaxies in galaxy surveys back to their initial position, the reconstructed density field is closer to a linear Gaussian field, with higher-order information moved back into the power spectrum. By combining power spectra measured from the pre- and post-reconstructed galaxy samples, higher-order information beyond the 2-point power spectrum can be efficiently extracted, as power spectra can be measured more quickly than direct measurements of the bispectrum and other higher order functions. This opens a new window to easily use higher-order information when constraining cosmological models.},

  abstract = {Future precision cosmology from large-scale structure experiments including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid will probe wider and deeper cosmic volumes than those covered by previous surveys. The Cartesian power spectrum analysis of anisotropic galaxy clustering based on the Fourier plane wave basis makes a number of assumptions, including the local plane-parallel approximation, that will no longer be valid on very large scales and may degrade cosmological constraints. We propose an approach that utilises a hybrid basis: on the largest scales, clustering statistics are decomposed into spherical Fourier modes which respect the natural geometry of both survey observations and physical effects along the line of sight, such as redshift-space distortions, the Alcock--Paczy\textbackslash 'nsky and light-cone effects; on smaller scales with far more clustering modes, we retain the computational benefit of the power spectrum analysis aided by fast Fourier transforms. This approach is particularly suited to the likelihood analysis of local primordial non-Gaussianity \$f\_\textbackslash textrm\{NL\}\$ through the scale-dependent halo bias, and we demonstrate its applicability with \$N\$-body simulations. We also release our public code Harmonia (https://github.com/MikeSWang/Harmonia) for galaxy clustering likelihood inference in spherical Fourier or hybrid-basis analyses.},

  abstract = {We present an improved method for calculating the parallel and perpendicular velocity correlation functions directly from peculiar velocity surveys using weighted maximum-likelihood estimators. A central feature of the new method is the use of position-dependent weighting scheme that reduces the influence of nearby galaxies, which are typically overrepresented relative to the more distant galaxies in most surveys. We demonstrate that the correlation functions calculated this way are less susceptible to biases due to our particular location in the Universe, and thus are more easily comparable to linear theory and between surveys. Our results suggest that the parallel velocity correlation function is a promising cosmological probe, given that it provides a better approximation of a Gaussian distribution than other velocity correlation functions and that its bias is more easily minimized by weighting. Though the position weighted parallel velocity correlation function increases the statistical uncertainty, it decreases the cosmic variance and is expected to provide more stable and tighter cosmological parameter constraints than other correlation methods in conjunction with more precise velocity surveys in the future.},

Here we report a cosmological simulation of the formation of present-day haloes over the full range of observed halo masses (20 orders of magnitude) when dark matter is assumed to be in the form of weakly interacting massive particles of mass approximately 100 gigaelectronvolts. The simulation has a full dynamic range of 30 orders of magnitude in mass and resolves the internal structure of hundreds of Earth-mass haloes in as much detail as it does for hundreds of rich galaxy clusters. We find that halo density profiles are universal over the entire mass range and are well described by simple two-parameter fitting formulae. Halo mass and concentration are tightly related in a way that depends on cosmology and on the nature of the dark matter. For a fixed mass, the concentration is independent of the local environment for haloes less massive than those of typical galaxies. Haloes over the mass range of 10\^3 to 10\^11 solar masses contribute about equally (per logarithmic interval) to the luminosity produced by dark matter annihilation, which we find to be smaller than all previous estimates by factors ranging up to one thousand.},

  abstract = {The bulk flow, i.e. the dipole moment of the peculiar velocity field, is a sensitive probe of matter density fluctuations on very large scales. However, the peculiar velocity surveys for which the bulk flow has been calculated have non-uniform spatial distributions of tracers, so that the bulk flow estimated does not correspond to that of a simple volume such as a sphere. Thus bulk flow estimates are generally not strictly comparable between surveys, even those whose effective depths are similar. In addition, the sparseness of typical surveys can lead to aliasing of small-scale power into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. Here we introduce a new method of calculating bulk flow moments where velocities are weighted to give an optimal estimate of the bulk flow of an idealized survey, with the variance of the difference between the estimate and the actual flow being minimized. These ‘minimum variance’ estimates can be designed to estimate the bulk flow on a particular scale with minimal sensitivity to small-scale power, and are comparable between surveys. We compile all major peculiar velocity surveys and apply this new method to them. We find that most surveys we studied are highly consistent with each other. Taken together the data suggest that the bulk flow within a Gaussian window of radius 50 h−1 Mpc is 407 ± 81 km s−1 toward l= 287°± 9°, b= 8°± 6°. The large-scale bulk motion is consistent with predictions from the local density field. This indicates that there are significant density fluctuations on very large scales. A flow of this amplitude on such a large scale is not expected in the WMAP5 (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) normalized Λ cold dark matter cosmology, for which the predicted one-dimensional rms velocity is ∼110 km s−1. The large amplitude of the observed bulk flow favours the upper values of the WMAP5 Ωmh2–σ8 error-ellipse, but even the point at the top of the WMAP595 per cent confidence ellipse predicts a bulk flow which is too low compared to that observed at \&gt;98 per cent confidence level.},

In addition, our method of examining the distribution of velocity errors should provide a useful check of the statistics of large peculiar velocity catalogues, particularly those that are compiled out of data from multiple sources.},

  abstract = {We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos and their mass assembly histories using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the ΛCDM cosmology. For each halo at z=0, we identify its merger history tree and determine concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late-forming galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that cvir ``observed'' at any epoch ao is strongly correlated with ac via cvir=c1ao/ac. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and ac, implying that the actual spread in cvir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in ac. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir and the scatter about the median cvir(M,z) using accretion histories derived from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations; this new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates, the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant, and the halo concentration just grows as Rvir. Because of the direct connection between halo concentration and velocity rotation curves and because of probable connections between halo mass assembly history and star formation history, the tight correlation between these properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.},

  abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein’s theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage IV” dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock–Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

In tests on N-body simulations with known initial conditions, the reconstruction procedure recovers accurate maps of the initial fluctuations from fully sampled, sparsely sampled, or biased data. Evolution of the reconstructed initial conditions yields credible reproductions of the input data.

Simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and dissipation form dense clumps of cold gas with sizes and masses similar to the luminous parts of galaxies. Models based on inflation and cold dark matter predict a healthy population of high redshift galaxies, including systems with star formation rates of 20 M\_\{\textbackslash sun\}/year at z=6. At z\textasciitilde 3, most of the baryons in these models reside in the low density intergalactic medium, which produces fluctuating Lyman-alpha absorption in the spectra of background quasars. The physical description of this ``Lyman-alpha forest'' is particularly simple if the absorption spectrum is viewed as a 1-dimensional map of a continuous medium instead of a collection of lines. The combination of superb observational data and robust numerical predictions makes the Lyman-alpha forest a promising tool for testing cosmological models.},

The sample covers 3600 deg\textsuperscript{2}, corresponding to a comoving volume of 9.7 (h\textsuperscript{-1} Gpc)\textsuperscript{3} assuming a fiducial Λ cold dark matter cosmology, and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z= 2. After accounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift-space correlation function is fitted well by a power law of slope -2 and amplitude s\textsubscript{0}= (9.7 ± 0.5) h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc over the range 3 \&lt; s \&lt; 25 h\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc.

There is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependence to the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range in our sample. Our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previous measurements at similar redshifts. Our measurement of the quasar clustering amplitude implies a bias factor of b≃ 3.5 for our quasar sample.

We find that the nongaussianity of the distribution substantially increases the sampling errors for the skewness and kurtosis in the several to tens of arcminutes regime, whereas those for the power spectrum are only fractionally increased even out to wavenumbers where shot noise from the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies will likely dominate the errors.},

Mock absorption spectra are generated using the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation which have approximately correct flux probability density functions and small-scale power spectra. On larger scales, there is clear evidence in the redshift-space correlation function for an acoustic feature, which matches a linear theory template with constant bias. These spectra, which we make publicly available, can be used to test pipelines, plan future experiments, and model various physical effects. As an illustration, we discuss the basic properties of the acoustic signal in the forest, the scaling of errors with noise and source number density, modified statistics to treat mean flux evolution and mis-estimation, and non-gravitational sources such as fluctuations in the photoionizing background and temperature fluctuations due to He II reionization.},

The acoustic feature in the large-scale correlation function of galaxies imprinted by sound waves in the early Universe has been successfully used as a `standard ruler' to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. The standard ruler can be improved if a process known as density field reconstruction is employed. In this paper we develop the Zeldovich formalism to compute the correlation function of biased tracers in both real- and redshift-space using the simplest reconstruction algorithm with a Gaussian kernel and compare to N-body simulations. The model qualitatively describes the effects of reconstruction on the simulations, though its quantitative success depends upon how redshift-space distortions are handled in the reconstruction algorithm.},

The galaxies in each mock catalogue have properties similar to those of the higher redshift galaxies measured by BOSS but differ in the details of how small-scale velocities and halo occupancy are determined. We find that all of the analytic models fit the simulations over a limited range of scales while failing at small scales. We discuss which models are most robust and on which scales they return reliable estimates of the rate of growth of structure: we find that models based on some form of resummation can fit our N-body data for BOSS-like galaxies above 30 h-1 Mpc well enough to return unbiased parameter estimates.},

We show that Lagrangian perturbation theories converge well and that the Zel'dovich approximation provides a good fit to the N-body results except for the quadrupole moment of the halo correlation function. We extend the calculation of halo bias to third order and also consider non-local biasing schemes, none of which remove the discrepancy. We argue that a part of the discrepancy owes to an incorrect prediction of inter-halo velocity correlations.

In this work, we explore whether measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities could allow us to improve upon neutrino mass constraints from galaxy redshift surveys alone. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that the galaxy peculiar motions \$\textbackslash textit\{do\}\$ contain information on the sum of the masses of neutrinos \$\textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\$, and that this information can be used to improve upon constraints that may be obtained from low-redshift galaxy surveys (\$z{$<$}0.5\$) combined with \$\textbackslash textit\{Planck\}\$ measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Compared to the full constraining power offered by \$\textbackslash textit\{Planck\}\$ and higher redshift DESI/Euclid data, we find that the benefit of including peculiar velocities only marginally improves neutrino mass constraints. However, when one is limited to modeling only quasi-linear scales, adds additional degrees of freedom via a varying number of effective neutrino species (\$N\_\{\textbackslash text\{eff\}\}\$), or does not include information from \$\textbackslash textit\{Planck\}\$, our results show that the inclusion of peculiar velocity measurements can still substantially improve upon the constraints. As such, we demonstrate that it may be possible to achieve upper bounds on \$\textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\$ (\$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\} = 0.051\$ eV; 68\% confidence limit) comparable to those from \$\textbackslash textit\{Planck\}\$, from spectroscopic galaxy surveys alone, as long as the peculiar velocity data is available. This could allow for an independent comparison between constraints on \$\textbackslash sum m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\$ from the early- and late-time Universe probes that are particularly timely given current cosmological parameter tensions.},

We show the MFs to be sensitive to contributions up to the six-point correlation function for this data set. We ensure with a custom angular mask that the results are more independent of boundary effects than in previous analyses of this type. We extract the higher order part of the MFs and quantify the difference to the case without higher order correlations. The resulting χ\textsuperscript{2} value of over 10 000 for a modest number of degrees of freedom, O(200), indicates a 100σ deviation and demonstrates that we have a highly significant signal of the non-Gaussian contributions to the galaxy distribution. This statistical power can be useful in testing models with differing higher order correlations. Comparing the galaxy data to the quick particle mesh and MultiDark(MD)-Patchy mocks, we find that the latter better describes the observed structure.

The fully automated SDSS spectroscopic reduction pipeline has provided spectra of unprecedented quality that cover the wavelength range 3800-9200Å. However, in common with spectra from virtually all multi-object surveys employing fibres, there remain significant systematic residuals in many of the spectra owing to the incomplete subtraction of the strong OH sky emission lines longward of 6700Å. These sky lines affect almost half the wavelength range of the SDSS spectra, and the S/N ratio over substantial wavelength regions in many spectra is reduced by more than a factor of 2 over that expected from counting statistics. We present a method to automatically remove the sky-residual signal, using a principal component analysis which takes advantage of the correlation in the form of the sky-subtraction residuals present in each spectrum. Application of the method results in spectra with essentially no evidence for degradation owing to the incomplete subtraction of OH emission features. A dramatic improvement in the quality of a substantial number of spectra, particularly those of faint objects such as the bulk of the high-redshift quasars, is achieved. We make available Interactive Data Language (IDL) code and documentation to implement the sky-residual subtraction scheme on SDSS spectra included in the public data releases. To ensure that absorption and emission features intrinsic to the object spectra do not affect the subtraction procedure, line masks must be created that depend on the scientific application of interest. We illustrate the power of the sky-residual subtraction scheme using samples of SDSS galaxy and quasar spectra, presenting tests involving the near-infrared CaII triplet absorption, metal absorption line features in damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems and composite spectra of high-redshift quasars.},

  abstract = {Accurate predictions for the nonlinear matter power spectrum are needed to confront theory with observations in current and near future weak-lensing and galaxy clustering surveys. We propose a computationally cheap method to create an emulator for modified gravity models by utilizing existing emulators for Λ CDM . Using a suite of N -body simulations, we construct a fitting function for the enhancement of both the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum in the commonly studied Hu-Sawicki f (R ) gravity model valid for wave numbers k ≲5 - 10 h Mpc-1 and redshifts z ≲3 . We show that the cosmology dependence of this enhancement is relatively weak so that our fit, using simulations coming from only one cosmology, can be used to get accurate predictions for other cosmological parameters. We also show that the cosmology dependence can, if needed, be included by using linear theory, approximate N -body simulations (such as comoving lagrangian acceleration) and semianalytical tools like the halo model. Our final fit can easily be combined with any emulator or semianalytical models for the nonlinear Λ CDM power spectrum to accurately, and quickly, produce a nonlinear power spectrum for this particular modified gravity model. The method we use can be applied to fairly cheaply construct an emulator for other modified gravity models. As an application of our fitting formula, we use it to compute Fisher forecasts for how well galaxy clustering and weak lensing in a Euclid-like survey will be at constraining modifications of gravity.},

This paper provides the first detailed comparison of the results of different N-body codes for the f (R), Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati and Symmetron models, starting from the same initial conditions. We find that the fractional deviation of the matter power spectrum from Λ cold dark matter agrees to better than 1 per cent up to k ∼ 5-10 h Mpc-1 between the different codes. These codes are thus able to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of upcoming observational surveys. All codes are also in good agreement in their results for the velocity divergence power spectrum, halo abundances and halo profiles. We also test the quasi-static limit, which is employed in most modified gravity N-body codes, for the Symmetron model for which the most significant non-static effects among the models considered are expected. We conclude that this limit is a very good approximation for all of the observables considered here.},

  abstract = {The increasing precision in the determination of the Hubble parameter has reached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced by inhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. Here, we use large-scale cosmological N-body simulations to study statistical properties of the local Hubble parameter as measured by local observers. We show that the distribution of the local Hubble parameter depends not only on the scale of inhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in the cosmic web and what reference frame is used. Observers located in random dark matter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at random positions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect is stronger from the halo rest frames compared to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) rest frame. We compare the predictions for the local Hubble parameter with observational constraints based on Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and CMB observations. Due to cosmic variance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the Hubble constant determined from nearby SNIa may differ from that measured from the CMB by ±0.8 per cent at 1σ statistical significance. This scatter is too small to significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between current measurements assuming a flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model. However, for observers located in the centres of the largest voids permitted by the standard ΛCDM model, we find that Hubble constant measurements from SNIa would be biased high by 5 per cent, rendering this tension non-existent in this extreme case.},

  abstract = {We propose an innovative method for measuring the neutral hydrogen (HI) content of an optically-selected spectroscopic sample of galaxies through cross-correlation with HI intensity mapping measurements. We show that the HI-galaxy cross-power spectrum contains an additive shot noise term which scales with the average HI brightness temperature of the optically-selected galaxies, allowing constraints to be placed on the average HI mass per galaxy. This approach can estimate the HI content of populations too faint to directly observe through their 21cm emission over a wide range of redshifts. This cross-correlation, as a function of optical luminosity or colour, can be used to derive HI-scaling relations. We demonstrate that this signal will be detectable by cross-correlating upcoming Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations with existing optically-selected samples. We also use semi-analytic simulations to verify that the HI mass can be successfully recovered by our technique in the range M\_HI {$>$} 10\^8 M\_solar, in a manner independent of the underlying power spectrum shape. We conclude that this method is a powerful tool to study galaxy evolution, which only requires a single intensity mapping dataset to infer complementary HI gas information from existing optical and infra-red observations.},

All lenses except the first are analysed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}\^\{+1.7\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{km\textasciitilde s\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$ , a \$2.4\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of H0 from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in 3.1σ tension with Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in 5.3σ tension with Planck CMB determinations of H0 in flat ΛCDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat ΛCDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with Planck. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our H0 inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on H0 ranges from ∼73 to 78 km s-1 Mpc-1, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

This makes the matter power-spectrum alone a poor probe to distinguish between modified gravity and the concordance ΛCDM model when neutrino masses are not strongly constrained. In this work, we investigate the potential of using redshift-space distortions (RSD) to break this degeneracy when the modification to gravity is scale-dependent in the form of Hu-Sawicki f(R). We find that if the linear growth rate can be recovered from the RSD signal, the degeneracy can be broken at the level of the dark matter field. However, this requires accurate modelling of the non-linearities in the RSD signal, and we here present an extension of the standard perturbation theory based model for non-linear RSD that includes both Hu-Sawicki f(R) modified gravity and massive neutrinos. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the  European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5σ point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

  abstract = {We present results from fitting the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the correlation function obtained from the first application of reconstruction to a galaxy redshift survey, namely, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogue. We also introduce more careful approaches for deriving a suitable covariance matrix and fitting model for galaxy correlation functions. These all aid in obtaining a more accurate measurement of the acoustic scale and its error. We validate our reconstruction, covariance matrix and fitting techniques on 160 mock catalogues derived from the LasDamas simulations in real and redshift space. We then apply these techniques to the DR7 LRG sample and find that the error on the acoustic scale decreases from \textasciitilde 3.5\% before reconstruction to \textasciitilde 1.9\% after reconstruction. This factor of 1.8 reduction in the error is equivalent to the effect of tripling the survey volume. We also see an increase in our BAO detection confidence from \textasciitilde 3-sigma to \textasciitilde 4-sigma after reconstruction with our confidence level in measuring the correct acoustic scale increasing from \textasciitilde 3-sigma to \textasciitilde 5-sigma. Using the mean of the acoustic scale probability distributions produced from our fits, we find D\_v/r\_s = 8.89 +/- 0.31 before reconstruction and 8.88 +/- 0.17 after reconstruction.},

Our work is the first to apply density-field reconstruction to an anisotropic analysis of the acoustic peak. Reconstruction partially removes the effects of non-linear evolution and redshift-space distortions in order to sharpen the acoustic signal. We present the theoretical framework behind the anisotropic BAO signal and give a detailed account of the fitting model we use to extract this signal from the data. Our method focuses only on the acoustic peak anisotropy, rather than the more model-dependent anisotropic information from the broad-band power. We test the robustness of our analysis methods on 160 Large Suite of Dark Matter Simulation DR7 mock catalogues and find that our models are unbiased at the ˜0.2 per cent level in measuring the BAO anisotropy. After reconstruction we measure DA(z = 0.35) = 1050 ± 38 Mpc and H(z = 0.35) = 84.4 ± 7.0 km s-1 Mpc-1 assuming a sound horizon of rs = 152.76 Mpc. Note that these measurements are correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.57. This represents a factor of 1.4 improvement in the error on DA relative to the pre-reconstruction case; a factor of 1.2 improvement is seen for H.},

  abstract = {Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), one of three core programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV, is an integral-field spectroscopic survey of roughly 10,000 nearby galaxies. It employs dithered observations using 17 hexagonal bundles of 2″ fibers to obtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3600-10300 Å. To map the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate spectral surface photometry, which is to calibrate the specific intensity at every spatial location sampled by each individual aperture element of the integral field unit. The calibration must correct only for the flux loss due to atmospheric throughput and the instrument response, but not for losses due to the finite geometry of the fiber aperture. This requires the use of standard star measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughput versus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopy techniques due to various practical limitations. Therefore, we developed a technique for spectral surface photometry using multiple small fiber-bundles targeting standard stars simultaneously with galaxy observations. We discuss the principles of our approach and how they compare to previous efforts, and we demonstrate the precision and accuracy achieved. MaNGA's relative calibration between the wavelengths of H$\alpha$ and Hβ has an rms of 1.7\%, while that between [N II] λ6583 and [O II] λ3727 has an rms of 4.7\%. Using extinction-corrected star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities as an illustration, this level of precision guarantees that flux calibration errors will be sub-dominant when estimating these quantities. The absolute calibration is better than 5\% for more than 89\% of MaNGA's wavelength range.},

  abstract = {Early-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are essential to constrain the properties of their progenitors. In this paper, we present high-quality light curves of 127 SNe Ia discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in 2018. We describe our method to perform forced point-spread function photometry, which can be applied to other types of extragalactic transients. With a planned cadence of six observations per night (three g + three r), all of the 127 SNe Ia are detected in both g and r bands more than 10 days (in the rest frame) prior to the epoch of g-band maximum light. The redshifts of these objects range from z = 0.0181 to 0.165; the median redshift is 0.074. Among the 127 SNe, 50 are detected at least 14 days prior to maximum light (in the rest frame), with a subset of nine objects being detected more than 17 days before g-band peak. This is the largest sample of young SNe Ia collected to date; it can be used to study the shape and color evolution of the rising light curves in unprecedented detail. We discuss six peculiar events in this sample: one 02cx-like event ZTF18abclfee (SN 2018crl), one Ia-CSM SN ZTF18aaykjei (SN 2018cxk), and four objects with possible super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors: ZTF18abhpgje (SN 2018eul), ZTF18abdpvnd (SN 2018dvf), ZTF18aawpcel (SN 2018cir), and ZTF18abddmrf (SN 2018dsx).},

  abstract = {Context. Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and their effects on the  matter power spectrum can be studied using the Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption signature of the matter density field along quasar (QSO) lines of sight. A measurement sufficiently accurate to provide useful cosmological constraints requires the observation of \textasciitilde 105 quasars in the redshift range 2.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.5 over \textasciitilde 8000 deg2. Such a survey is planned by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) project of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). Aims: We assess one of the challenges for this project, that of building from five-band imaging data a list of targets that contains the largest number of quasars in the required redshift range. In practice, we perform a stellar rejection of more than two orders of magnitude with a selection efficiency for quasars better than 50\% to magnitudes as bright as g \textasciitilde{} 22. Methods: To obtain an appropriate target list and estimate quasar redshifts, we develop artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a multilayer perceptron architecture. The input variables are photometric measurements, i.e., the object magnitudes and their errors in the five bands (ugriz) of the SDSS photometry. The ANN developed for target selection provides a continuous output variable between 0 for non-quasar point-like objects to 1 for quasars. A second ANN estimates the QSO redshift z using the photometric information. Results: For target selection, we achieve a non-quasar point-like object rejection of 99.6\% and 98.5\% for a quasar efficiency of, respectively, 50\% and 85\%, comparable to the performances of traditional methods. The photometric redshift precision is on the order of 0.1 over the region relevant to BAO studies. These statistical methods, developed in the context of the BOSS project, can easily be extended to any quasar selection and/or determination of their photometric redshift.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on masses of active and sterile neutrinos. We use the one-dimensional Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$-forest power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) and from the VLT/XSHOOTER legacy survey (XQ-100). In this paper, we present our own measurement of the power spectrum with the publicly released XQ-100 quasar spectra. Fitting Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellent agreement with the values derived independently from Planck 2015 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Combining BOSS and XQ-100 Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ power spectra, we constrain the sum of neutrino masses to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu {$<$} 0.8\$ eV (95\textbackslash\% C.L). With the addition of CMB data, this bound is tightened to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu {$<$} 0.14\$ eV (95\textbackslash\% C.L.). With their sensitivity to small scales, Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ data are ideal to constrain \$\textbackslash Lambda\$WDM models. Using XQ-100 alone, we issue lower bounds on pure dark matter particles: \$m\_X \textbackslash gtrsim 2.08 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ (95\textbackslash\% C.L.) for early decoupled thermal relics, and \$m\_s \textbackslash gtrsim 10.2 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ (95\textbackslash\% C.L.) for non-resonantly produced right-handed neutrinos. Combining the 1D Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forest power spectrum measured by BOSS and XQ-100, we improve the two bounds to \$m\_X \textbackslash gtrsim 4.17 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ and \$m\_s \textbackslash gtrsim 25.0 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ (95\textbackslash\% C.L.). The \$3\textasciitilde\textbackslash sigma\$ bound shows a more significant improvement, increasing from \$m\_X \textbackslash gtrsim 2.74 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ for BOSS alone to \$m\_X \textbackslash gtrsim 3.10 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ for the combined BOSS+XQ-100 data set. Finally, we include in our analysis the first two redshift bins (\$z=4.2\$ and \$z=4.6\$) of the power spectrum measured with the high-resolution HIRES/MIKE spectrographs. The addition of HIRES/MIKE power spectrum allows us to further improve the two limits to \$m\_X \textbackslash gtrsim 4.65 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ and \$m\_s \textbackslash gtrsim 28.8 \textbackslash : \textbackslash rm\{keV\}\$ (95\textbackslash\% C.L.).},

  abstract = {Using synthetic Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ forests from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we present a study of the impact of errors in the estimation of quasar redshift on the Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ correlation functions. Estimates of quasar redshift have large uncertainties of a few hundred \$\textbackslash text\{km s\}\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,\$ due to the broadness of the emission lines and the intrinsic shifts from other emission lines. We inject Gaussian random redshift errors into the mock quasar catalogues, and measure the auto-correlation and the Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$-quasar cross-correlation functions. We find a smearing of the BAO feature in the radial direction, but changes in the peak position are negligible. However, we see a significant unphysical correlation for small separations transverse to the line of sight which increases with the amplitude of the redshift errors. We interpret this contamination as a result of the broadening of emission lines in the measured mean continuum, caused by quasar redshift errors, combined with the unrealistically strong clustering of the simulated quasars on small scales.},

Specifically, we model the galaxy colors of IllustrisTNG and apply sliding DESI color-magnitude cuts, matching the DESI target densities. We study the halo occupation distribution model (HOD) of the selected samples by matching them to their corresponding dark matter halos in the IllustrisTNG dark matter run. We find the HOD of both the LRG and ELG samples to be consistent with their respective baseline models, but also we find important deviations from common assumptions about the satellite distribution, velocity bias, and galaxy secondary biases. We identify strong evidence for concentration-based and environment-based occupational variance in both samples, an effect known as "galaxy assembly bias". The central and satellite galaxies have distinct dependencies on secondary halo properties, showing that centrals and satellites have distinct evolutionary trajectories and should be modelled separately. These results serve to inform the necessary complexities in modeling galaxy-halo connection for DESI analyses and also prepare for building high-fidelity mock galaxies. Finally, we present a shuffling-based clustering analysis that reveals a 10-15\% excess in the LRG clustering of modest statistical significance due to secondary galaxy biases. We also find a similar excess signature for the ELGs, but with much lower statistical significance. When a larger hydrodynamical simulation volume becomes available, we expect our analysis pipeline to pinpoint the exact sources of such excess clustering signatures.},

  abstract = {We present a novel simulation-based hybrid emulator approach that maximally derives cosmological and Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) information from non-linear galaxy clustering, with sufficient precision for DESI Year 1 (Y1) analysis. Our hybrid approach first samples the HOD space on a fixed cosmological simulation grid to constrain the high-likelihood region of cosmology+HOD parameter space, and then constructs the emulator within this constrained region. This approach significantly reduces the parameter volume emulated over, thus achieving much smaller emulator errors with fixed number of training points. We demonstrate that this combined with state-of-the-art simulations result in tight emulator errors comparable to expected DESI Y1 LRG sample variance. We leverage the new AbacusSummit simulations and apply our hybrid approach to CMASS non-linear galaxy clustering data. We infer constraints on \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.762\textbackslash pm0.024\$ and \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8 (z\_\{eff\} = 0.52) = 0.444\textbackslash pm0.016\$, the tightest among contemporary galaxy clustering studies. We also demonstrate that our \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ constraint is robust against secondary biases and other HOD model choices, a critical first step towards showcasing the robust cosmology information accessible in non-linear scales. We speculate that the additional statistical power of DESI Y1 should tighten the growth rate constraints by at least another 50-60\%, significantly elucidating any potential tension with Planck. We also address the "lensing is low" tension, where we find that the combined effect of a lower \$f\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ and environment-based bias lowers the predicted lensing signal by 15\%, accounting for approximately 50\% of the discrepancy between the lensing measurement and clustering-based predictions.},

We apply SHAM on the UNIT simulation to simulate SDSS BOSS/eBOSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) within a wide redshift range of \$0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.0\$. Besides the typical SHAM scatter parameter \$\textbackslash sigma\$, we include \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm smear\}\$ and \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm ceil\}\$ to take into account the redshift uncertainty and the galaxy incompleteness respectively. These two additional parameters are critical for reproducing the observed 2PCF multipoles on 5--25\$\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. The redshift uncertainties obtained from the best-fitting \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm smear\}\$ agree with those measured from repeat observations for all SDSS LRGs except for the LOWZ sample. We explore several potential systematics but none of them can explain the discrepancy found in LOWZ. Our explanation is that the LOWZ galaxies might contain another type of galaxies which needs to be treated differently. The evolution of the measured \$\textbackslash sigma\$ and \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm ceil\}\$ also reveals that the incompleteness of eBOSS galaxies decreases with the redshift. This is the consequence of the magnitude lower limit applied in eBOSS LRG target selection. Our SHAM also set upper limits for the intrinsic scatter of the galaxy--halo relation given a complete galaxy sample: \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm int\}{$<$}0.31\$ for LOWZ at \$0.2},

We use the Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory approach with a Gaussian Streaming model for the redshift space distortions of the correlation function and demonstrate its applicability for dark matter haloes hosting eBOSS quasar tracers.

The quoted uncertainties include both systematic and statistical contributions. The results on the evolution of distances are consistent with the predictions of flat Λ-cold dark matter cosmology with Planck parameters, and the measurement of fσ8 extends the validity of General Relativity to higher redshifts (z {$>$} 1). This paper is released with companion papers using the same sample. The results on the cosmological parameters of the studies are found to be in very good agreement, providing clear evidence of the complementarity and of the robustness of the first full-shape clustering measurements with the eBOSS DR14 quasar sample.},

We use the cosmological distribution of neutral hydrogen, as probed by the Ly $\alpha$ forest seen towards distant quasars.

We use combined information from Data Releases 12 and 14 to select a sample of 142 661 quasars most suitable for this purpose. The scales covered by the data extend beyond post-inflation causality scales, thus probing initial conditions in the early Universe. We identify significant spatially correlated systematic effects that can emulate cosmological anisotropy. Once these systematics have been accounted for, the data are found to be consistent with isotropy, providing an important independent check on the standard model, consistent with results from cosmic microwave background data.},

Although our simulations are based on \$w\$CDM with general relativity (GR), we include a scaling parameter of the halo velocity field, \$\textbackslash gamma\_f\$, defined as the amplitude of the halo velocity field relative to the GR prediction. We divide the BOSS data into three redshift bins. After marginalizing over other cosmological parameters, galaxy bias parameters, and the velocity scaling parameter, we find \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}(z=0.25) = 0.404\textbackslash pm0.03\$, \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}(z=0.4) = 0.444\textbackslash pm0.025\$ and \$f\textbackslash sigma\_\{8\}(z=0.55) = 0.385\textbackslash pm0.019\$. Compared with Planck observations using a flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model, our results are lower by \$2.29\textbackslash sigma\$, \$1.3\textbackslash sigma\$ and \$4.58\textbackslash sigma\$ respectively. These results are consistent with other recent simulation-based results at non-linear scales, including weak lensing measurements of BOSS LOWZ galaxies, two-point clustering of eBOSS LRGs, and an independent clustering analysis of BOSS LOWZ. All these results are generally consistent with a combination of \$\textbackslash gamma\_f\^\{1/2\}\textbackslash sigma\_8\textbackslash approx 0.75\$. We note, however, that the BOSS data is well fit assuming GR, i.e. \$\textbackslash gamma\_f=1\$.

Among the models we consider, the large-scale growth of structure data does not affect the modified gravity models as a category particularly differently from dark energy models; it matters for some modified gravity models but not others, and the same is true for dark energy models.

The statistical properties of the distribution and evolution of both hydrogen and helium absorption lines are extracted and compared to observed data. We find excellent agreement for the following neutral hydrogen data: the distribution of column densities is fitted well by a power law with exponent beta = 1.55, with a possible deficiency of lines above column density 1015 cm-2; the integrated distribution matches observed data over a broad range of column densities, 1013--1017 cm-2; a Gaussian statistical fit to the Doppler parameter distribution yields a median of 35.6 km s-1; the evolution of the number of clouds with column densities larger than 1014 cm-2 follows a power law with exponent gamma = 2.22. Analogous calculations are presented for He II absorption lines, and we find the ratio of Doppler parameters bHe II/bH I = 0.87. Our data also suggest that Ly alpha clouds may belong to two morphologically different groups: small column density clouds which tend to reside in sheets or filamental structures and are very elongated and/or flattened, and the large column density clouds which are typically found at the intersections of these caustic structures and are quasi-spherical.},

  abstract = {We measure the sum of the neutrino particle masses using the three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS galaxy sample. Combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernova (SN) and additional baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, we find upper 95 percent confidence limits of the neutrino mass \$\textbackslash Sigma m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}{$<$}0.340\$ eV within a flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM background, and \$\textbackslash Sigma m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}{$<$}0.821\$ eV, assuming a more general background cosmological model. The number of neutrino species is measured to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=4.308\textbackslash pm0.794\$ and \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=4.032\^\{+0.870\}\_\{-0.894\}\$ for these two cases respectively. We study and quantify the effect of several factors on the neutrino measurements, including the galaxy power spectrum bias model, the effect of redshift-space distortion, the cutoff scale of the power spectrum, and the choice of additional data. The impact of neutrinos with unknown masses on other cosmological parameter measurements is investigated. The fractional matter density and the Hubble parameter are measured to be \$\textbackslash Omega\_M=0.2796\textbackslash pm0.0097\$, \$H\_0=69.72\^\{+0.90\}\_\{-0.91\}\$ km/s/Mpc (flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM) and \$\textbackslash Omega\_M=0.2798\^\{+0.0132\}\_\{-0.0136\}\$, \$H\_0=73.78\^\{+3.16\}\_\{-3.17\}\$ km/s/Mpc (more general background model). Based on a Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation of the equation-of-state \$w\$ of dark energy, we find that \$w=-1\$ is consistent with observations, even allowing for neutrinos. Similarly, the curvature \textbackslash Omega\_K and the running of the spectral index \$\textbackslash alpha\_s\$ are both consistent with zero. The tensor-to-scaler ratio is constrained down to \$r{$<$}0.198\$ (95 percent CL, flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ CDM) and \$r{$<$}0.440\$ (95 percent CL, more general background model).},

Combining our measurement with BOSS DR12 and Planck observations, we constrain the gravitational growth index to be γ = 0.580 ± 0.082, which is fully consistent with the prediction of general relativity.

By extending the Zel'dovich approximation density field with an effective tracer bias model calibrated with the clustering measurements from the observational data, we accurately reproduce the two- and three-point clustering statistics of the eBOSS DR16 tracers, including their cross-correlations in redshift space with very low computational costs. In addition, we include the gravitational evolution of structures and sample selection biases at different redshifts, as well as various photometric and spectroscopic systematic effects. The agreements on the auto-clustering statistics between the data and mocks are generally within \$1\textbackslash, \textbackslash sigma\$ variances inferred from the mocks, for scales down to a few \$h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ in configuration space, and up to \$0.3\textbackslash, h\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ in Fourier space.

  abstract = {We present a science forecast for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) survey. Focusing on discrete tracers, we forecast the expected accuracy of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements, the fNL parameter quantifying the primordial non-Gaussianity, the dark energy and modified gravity parameters. We also use the line-of-sight clustering in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest to constrain the total neutrino mass. We find that eBOSS luminous red galaxies, emission line galaxies and clustering quasars can achieve a precision of 1, 2.2 and 1.6 per cent, respectively, for spherically averaged BAO distance measurements. Using the same samples, the constraint on fσ8 is expected to be 2.5, 3.3 and 2.8 per cent, respectively. For primordial non-Gaussianity, eBOSS alone can reach an accuracy of σ(fNL) ˜ 10-15. eBOSS can at most improve the dark energy figure of merit by a factor of 3 for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, and can well constrain three eigenmodes for the general equation-of-state parameter. eBOSS can also significantly improve constraints on modified gravity parameters by providing the RSD information, which is highly complementary to constraints obtained from weak lensing measurements. A principal component analysis shows that eBOSS can measure the eigenmodes of the effective Newton's constant to 2 per cent precision; this is a factor of 10 improvement over that achievable without eBOSS. Finally, we derive the eBOSS constraint (combined with Planck, Dark Energy Survey and BOSS) on the total neutrino mass, σ(Σmν) = 0.03 eV (68 per cent CL), which in principle makes it possible to distinguish between the two scenarios of neutrino mass hierarchies.},

  abstract = {We construct a composite quasar spectrum from 284 HST FOS spectra of 101 quasars with redshifts z {$>$} 0.33. The spectrum covers the wavelengths between 350 and 3000 Å in the rest frame, with a peak S/N level of \textasciitilde 130 per Å at \textasciitilde 1200 Å. Since \textasciitilde 90\% of the sample quasars have redshift z {$<$} 1.5, the spectrum is suitable for studying the wavelength region shortward of Ly$\alpha$ without large effects from intervening Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption. Data in the waveband between 350 and 600 Å are mainly from the spectra of z {$>$} 1.5 quasars, for which significant corrections for the accumulated Lyman-series line and continuum absorption have been applied. There is a significant steepening of the continuum slope around 1050 Å. The continuum between 1050 and 2200 Å can be modeled as a power law fν \textasciitilde{} ν$\alpha$ with $\alpha$ = -0.99 +/- 0.05. For the full sample the power-law index in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) between 350 and 1050 Å is $\alpha$ = -1.96 +/- 0.15. For the radio-loud subsample (60 objects), the EUV spectral index is $\alpha$ \textasciitilde = -2.2, while for the radio-quiet subsample (41 objects) it is $\alpha$ \textasciitilde = -1.8. The continuum flux in the wavelengths near the Lyman limit shows a depression of \textasciitilde 10\%. The break in the power-law index and the slight depression of the continuum near the Lyman limit are features expected in Comptonized accretion-disk spectra. Comptonization produces a power-law tail in the wavelength band shortward of \textasciitilde 1000 Å and smears out the Lyman-limit edge of the intrinsic accretion-disk spectrum. In the EUV waveband, we detect several possible emission features, including one around 690 Å that may be O III + N III produced by the Bowen fluorescence effect. Comparing our composite spectrum with one made at higher redshifts by Francis et al., we find that the equivalent widths of Ly$\alpha$ and high-ionization emission lines are larger in our sample, reflecting a known luminosity dependence. The equivalent widths of low-ionization lines do not exhibit such a dependence, suggesting that the quasar EUV continuum above \textasciitilde 50 eV is steeper at higher luminosity. Radio-quiet quasars appear to show a slightly harder continuum and lower ionization levels in their emission lines. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

  abstract = {We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 (z\textasciitilde 1) and SDSS (z\textasciitilde 0) galaxies within the HOD framework. At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases at higher luminosity. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z\textasciitilde 0 central galaxies to z\textasciitilde 1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z\textasciitilde 0 low-mass halos (\textasciitilde 5×1011 h-1 Msolar) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high-mass halos (\textasciitilde 1013 h-1 Msolar) result from star formation between z\textasciitilde 1 and z\textasciitilde 0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work that combines HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.},

The effects of self-shielding introduce a hump in this distribution, at a column density of NHI\textasciitilde 1.6×1017X-1 cm-2, where X is the neutral fraction at the radius where self-shielding starts being important. The most recent compilation of the column density distribution, by Storrie-Lombardi \& Wolfe, shows marginal evidence for the detection of this feature owing to self-shielding, suggesting a value of X\textasciitilde =10-3. Assuming a photoionization rate of Γ\textasciitilde =10-12 s-1 from the external ionizing background, the radius where self-shielding occurs is inferred to be \textasciitilde 3.8 kpc. If damped Ly$\alpha$ systems consist of a clumpy medium, this should be interpreted as the typical size of the gas clumps in the region where they become self-shielding. Clumps of this size with typical column densities of NH\textasciitilde 3×1020 cm-2 would be gravitationally confined at the characteristic photoionization temperature of \textasciitilde 104 K if they do not contain dark matter. Since this size is similar to the overall radius of damped Ly$\alpha$ systems in cold dark matter models, where all halos are assumed to contain similar gas clouds producing damped absorbers, this suggests that the gas in damped absorbers is in fact not highly clumped.},

  abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between  galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semianalytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function M for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. Since the number of central galaxies is always zero or one, the width of P(N|M) is narrower than a Poisson distribution at low N and approaches Poisson at high N. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1\textasciitilde 14Mmin (SPH) or M1\textasciitilde 18Mmin (SA). The stellar population age of central galaxies correlates with halo mass, and this correlation explains much of the age dependence of the galaxy HOD. The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M\textasciitilde 10Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. Using the SA model, we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a ``bump'' at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

  abstract = {We present an anisotropic analysis of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 14 quasar sample. The sample consists of 147 000 quasars distributed over a redshift range of 0.8 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.2. We apply the redshift weights technique to the clustering of quasars in this sample and achieve a 4.6 per cent measurement of the angular distance measurement D\textsubscript{M} at z = 2.2 and Hubble parameter H at z = 0.8. We parametrize the distance-redshift relation, relative to a fiducial model, as a Taylor series. The coefficients of this expansion are used to reconstruct the distance-redshift relation and obtain distance and Hubble parameter measurements at all redshifts within the redshift range of the sample. Reporting the result at two characteristic redshifts, we determine D\textsubscript{M}(z = 1) = 3405 ± 305 (r\textsubscript{d}/r\textsubscript{d, fid}) Mpc, H(z=1) = 120.7± 7.3 (r\_d,fid / r\_d) km s\^\{-1\} Mpc\^\{-1\} and D\textsubscript{M}(z = 2) = 5325 ± 249 (r\textsubscript{d}/r\textsubscript{d, fid}) Mpc, H(z=2) = 189.9± 32.9 (r\_d,fid / r\_d) km s\^\{-1\} Mpc\^\{-1\}. These measurements are highly correlated. We assess the outlook of BAO analysis from the final quasar sample by testing the method on a set of mocks that mimic the noise level in the final sample. We demonstrate on these mocks that redshift weighting shrinks the measurement error by over 25 per cent on average. We conclude redshift weighting can bring us closer to the cosmological goal of the final quasar sample.},

  abstract = {Large redshift surveys of galaxies and clusters are providing the first opportunities to search for distortions in the observed pattern of large-scale structure due to such effects as gravitational redshift. We focus on non-linear scales and apply a quasi-Newtonian approach using N-body simulations to predict the small asymmetries in the cross-correlation function of two galaxy different populations. Following recent work by Bonvin et al., Zhao and Peacock and Kaiser on galaxy clusters, we include effects which enter at the same order as gravitational redshift: the transverse Doppler effect, light-cone effects, relativistic beaming, luminosity distance perturbation and wide-angle effects. We find that all these effects cause asymmetries in the cross-correlation functions. Quantifying these asymmetries, we find that the total effect is dominated by the gravitational redshift and luminosity distance perturbation at small and large scales, respectively. By adding additional subresolution modelling of galaxy structure to the large-scale structure information, we find that the signal is significantly increased, indicating that structure on the smallest scales is important and should be included. We report on comparison of our simulation results with measurements from the SDSS/BOSS galaxy redshift survey in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {We present rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectroscopy of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 0.6 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.2 from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) in SDSS-IV. One of the eBOSS programs is to obtain 2″ (about 15 kpc) fiber spectra of about 200,000 emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at redshift z ≳ 0.6. We use the data from the pilot observations of this program, including 8620 spectra of SFGs at 0.6 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.2. The median composite spectra of these SFGs at 2200 Å \&lt; λ \&lt; 4000 Å feature asymmetric, preferentially blueshifted non-resonant emission, Fe ii*, and blueshifted resonant absorption, e.g., Fe ii and Mg ii, indicating ubiquitous outflows driven by star formation at these redshifts. For the absorption lines, we find a variety of velocity profiles with different degrees of blueshift. Comparing our new observations with the literature, we do not observe the non-resonant emission in the small-aperture (\&lt;40 pc) spectra of local star-forming regions with the Hubble Space Telescope, and find the observed line ratios in the SFG spectra to be different from those in the spectra of local star-forming regions, as well as those of quasar absorption-line systems in the same redshift range. We introduce an outflow model that can simultaneously explain the multiple observed properties and suggest that the variety of absorption velocity profiles and the line ratio differences are caused by scattered fluorescent emission filling in on top of the absorption in the large-aperture eBOSS spectra. We develop an observation-driven, model-independent method to correct the emission infill to reveal the true absorption profiles. Finally, we show that the strengths of both the non-resonant emission and the emission-corrected resonant absorption increase with [O ii] λλ3727, 3730 rest equivalent width and luminosity, with a slightly larger dependence on the former. Our results show that the eBOSS and future dark-energy surveys (e.g., Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey and Prime Focus Spectrograph survey) will provide rich data sets of rest-frame NUV spectroscopy for astrophysical applications.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new generic Archetype technique for source classification and identification, based on the NP-complete set cover problem (SCP) in computer science and operations research (OR). We have developed a new heuristic SCP solver, by combining the greedy algorithm and the Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) approximation method. We test the performance of our code on the test cases from Beasley's OR Library and show that our SCP solver can efficiently yield solutions that are on average 99\% optimal in terms of the cost. We discuss how to adopt SCP for classification purposes and put forward a new Archetype technique. We use an optical spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as an example to illustrate the steps of the technique. We show how the technique naturally selects a basis set of physically-motivated archetypal systems to represent all the extragalactic sources in the sample. We discuss several key aspects in the technique and in any general classification scheme, including distance metric, dimensionality, and measurement uncertainties. We briefly discuss the relationships between the Archetype technique and other machine-learning techniques, such as the \$k\$-means clustering method. Finally, our code is publicly available and the technique is generic and easy to use and expand. We expect that it can help maximize the potential for astrophysical sciences of the low-S/N spectroscopic data from future dark-energy surveys, and can find applications in many fields of astronomy, including the formation and evolution of a variety of astrophysical systems, such as galaxies, stars and planets. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Reconstruction is becoming a crucial procedure of galaxy clustering analysis for future spectroscopic redshift surveys to obtain subper cent level measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. Most reconstruction algorithms rely on an estimation of the displacement field from the observed galaxy distribution. However, the displacement reconstruction degrades near the survey boundary due to incomplete data and the boundary effects extend to \$\{\textbackslash sim\}100\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}/h\$ within the interior of the survey volume. We study the possibility of using radial velocities measured from the cosmic microwave background observation through the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect to improve performance near the boundary. We find that the boundary effect can be reduced to \$\{\textbackslash sim\}30-40\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}/h\$ with the velocity information from Simons Observatory. This is especially helpful for dense low redshift surveys where the volume is relatively small and a large fraction of total volume is affected by the boundary.},

  abstract = {Large redshift surveys capable of measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal have proven to be an effective way of measuring the distance-redshift relation in cosmology. Building off the work in Zhu et al. (2015), we develop a technique to directly constrain the distance-redshift relation from BAO measurements without splitting the sample into redshift bins. We parametrize the distance-redshift relation, relative to a fiducial model, as a quadratic expansion. We measure its coefficients and reconstruct the distance-redshift relation from the expansion. We apply the redshift weighting technique in Zhu et al. (2015) to the clustering of galaxies from 1000 QuickPM (QPM) mock simulations after reconstruction and achieve a 0.75\% measurement of the angular diameter distance \$D\_A\$ at \$z=0.64\$ and the same precision for Hubble parameter H at \$z=0.29\$. These QPM mock catalogs are designed to mimic the clustering and noise level of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). We compress the correlation functions in the redshift direction onto a set of weighted correlation functions. These estimators give unbiased \$D\_A\$ and \$H\$ measurements at all redshifts within the range of the combined sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of redshift weighting in improving the distance and Hubble parameter estimates. Instead of measuring at a single 'effective' redshift as in traditional analyses, we report our \$D\_A\$ and \$H\$ measurements at all redshifts. The measured fractional error of \$D\_A\$ ranges from 1.53\% at \$z=0.2\$ to 0.75\% at \$z=0.64\$. The fractional error of \$H\$ ranges from 0.75\% at \$z=0.29\$ to 2.45\% at \$z = 0.7\$. Our measurements are consistent with a Fisher forecast to within 10\% to 20\% depending on the pivot redshift. We further show the results are robust against the choice of fiducial cosmologies, galaxy bias models, and RSD streaming parameters.},
