First, I would like to thank the jury members that accepted the invitation 
to review this manuscript and for their challenging questions which 
triggered interesting discussions during the defense. Their experience 
and varied background made this evaluation much richer. 

Secondly, I want to thank Dominique Fouchez and Cristinel Diaconu, 
for believing in my potential for research and teaching, and welcoming me 
in Marseille, now three years ago. 

I am only here today thanks to the trust of those that hired me in the past. 
Thank you Kyle Dawson, for welcoming me in Utah - USA and showing me the guts of 
a spectroscopic survey, and how important each bolt and screw is for constraining 
cosmology. Thank you Will Percival, for inviting me for a postdoc in Portsmouth - UK,
believing that I could lead research and supervise PhD students, and making me part of 
such a great group of cosmologists. I want to thank Florian Beutler and David Bacon 
for their experienced guidance during this time in England. 



Family, Tucho, Monica, Abuela,
